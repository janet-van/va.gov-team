# FMP Benefits Authorization Letter – Test Plan

**Feature:** Foreign Medical Program (FMP) Benefits Authorization Letter  
**Date:** 2026-03-18  
**Environments:** Local, Staging  

---

## Feature Flag Overview

| Flag | Scope | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter` | Web + Mobile (global gate) | Master on/off switch. Supports progressive rollout via individual user targeting or percentage-based enablement. When disabled, neither web nor mobile surfaces the FMP letter. |
| `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter_mobile` | Mobile (all app versions) | Must be enabled for the letter to appear on mobile regardless of app version. Also serves as the sole mobile gate for users who have **not** updated to the version containing `FMPAvailable`. |
| `FMPAvailable` | Mobile only (updated app) | In-app flag required in addition to `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter_mobile`. Only present in updated app builds. Both this **and** `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter_mobile` must be ON for the updated app to show the letter. |

### Flag Dependency Logic

```
fmp_benefits_authorization_letter (master)
    ├── OFF → letter unavailable everywhere (web + mobile)
    └── ON
          ├── Web → letter visible on vets-website
          └── Mobile
                ├── fmp_benefits_authorization_letter_mobile OFF → letter not visible (any app version)
                └── fmp_benefits_authorization_letter_mobile ON
                      ├── App NOT updated (no FMPAvailable) → letter visible ✅
                      └── App IS updated (has FMPAvailable)
                            ├── FMPAvailable OFF → letter not visible ❌
                            └── FMPAvailable ON  → letter visible ✅
```

## Screenshot Note

**Image Reuse:** Although some test scenarios reference the same screenshot images to reduce the number of files, all images have been fully tested and confirmed to accurately match their respective scenarios.

## Regression test plan (QA1)

Regression coverage for this feature includes:

- Existing letter list behavior remains unchanged for non-targeted and ineligible users.
- Existing letter download behavior remains unchanged for all previously available letter types.
- Feature-flag gating precedence remains intact across web and mobile (`master -> mobile -> FMPAvailable`).
- Mobile old-build behavior remains compatible when `FMPAvailable` is not present.
- Error handling and user messaging continue to work for failed download and unavailable-letter states.

## Traceability reports (QA3)

The product must have a Coverage for References report that demonstrates user stories are verified by test cases in the test plan. The product must also have a Summary (Defects) report that demonstrates that defects found during QA testing were identified through test case execution.

### Coverage for References report

Use this report to map each approved story to one or more executed test cases.

| Story / Requirement Reference | Test Case ID(s) | Environment | Execution Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FMP-AL-001 (Web letter visibility) | W-1, W-2a, W-2b, W-3 | Local / Staging | Local - Pass, Staging - Pass| Screenshots below |
| FMP-AL-002 (Mobile old-build gating) | M-1, M-2, M-3, SM-1, SM-2 | Local / Staging | Local - Pass, Staging - Pass | Screenshots below |
| FMP-AL-003 (Mobile updated-app gating) | M-4, M-5, M-6, M-7, SM-3, SM-4 | Local / Staging | Local - Pass, Staging - blocked until staging merge | Screenshots below |
| FMP-AL-004 (Download + PDF validation) | W-2a, M-6, SW-1a, SM-4 | Local / Staging | Local - Pass, Staging - Pass | Screenshots below |

### Summary (Defects) report

Use this report to show that each defect came from an executed test case and was tracked to resolution.

| Defect ID | Found In Test Case | Environment | Severity | Status | Retest Case / Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|TBD|---|---|---|---|---|

**Note**: No defects have been found so far during executed QA test case runs.

### Logging Silent Failures (QA7)

Capture failures that do not surface a user-visible error so they can be detected and triaged quickly.

FMP letter list fetch failures are tracked and surfaced through multiple layers:

- Analytics failure event is recorded when list fetch fails.
- Exception capture is sent to error monitoring for diagnostics.
- UI fallback/status dispatches are triggered for failed list retrieval.
- Reducer maps and stores failure states for rendering logic.
- Main view renders system-down or error states based on mapped failure status.

FMP letter download failures in the enhanced letters path are surfaced to users:

- Blob-fetch failure dispatch updates application failure state.
- Enhanced letter failure state is set in centralized state handling.
- User-facing error alert is displayed in the download flow.

Unit-test coverage verifies failure handling behavior:

- Tests verify letter-list failure dispatches and error-monitoring reporting.
- Tests verify enhanced-letter download failure dispatch behavior.

### No Cross-App Dependencies (QA12)

This has been completed: the application is built in isolation with no cross-app dependencies, excluding static pages and platform components.

## 2. Staging Testing

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- [x] Flipper flags configured in staging environment (verify via staging Flipper UI or `vets-api` console)
- [x] Staging test accounts with FMP eligibility confirmed
  - **Eligible (has FMP letter):** staging user 64
  - **Ineligible (no FMP letter):** staging user 100
- [ ] Mobile staging build deployed (both old and new app versions if available in staging) - currently old available
- [ ] Coordinate with VA mobile team on `FMPAvailable` flag state in staging 

---

### 2.2 Staged Rollout Sequence

Staging tests should follow the intended production rollout order. The master flag `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter` uses progressive rollout — start with individual users, then expand by percentage.

**Phase 1 – Web only, single user targeting**
1. Enable `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter` for staging user 64 only
2. Keep `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter_mobile` = disabled
3. Confirm web works for targeted user; confirm all mobile and non-targeted web users do NOT see the letter

**Phase 2 – Web only, percentage rollout**
1. Expand `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter` to a small percentage (e.g. 10%)
2. Keep `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter_mobile` = disabled
3. Monitor Datadog for errors; confirm mobile still unaffected

**Phase 3 – Mobile (updated app)**
1. Increase `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter` percentage as confidence grows
2. Enable `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter_mobile` and `FMPAvailable`
3. Confirm updated app shows letter; confirm old app also shows letter via `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter_mobile`

**Phase 4 – Full rollout**
1. Expand `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter` to 100%
2. Confirm letter available to all eligible veterans across web and mobile

## 3. Flag State Matrix Summary

| `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter` | `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter_mobile` | `FMPAvailable` | Web | Old App | Updated App |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OFF | any | any | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ON | OFF | any | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ON | ON | n/a (old app) | ✅ | invalid | — |
| ON | ON | OFF | ✅ | invalid | ❌ |
| ON | ON | ON | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

> `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter` uses progressive rollout (single user targeting → percentage → 100%). `fmp_benefits_authorization_letter_mobile` must be ON for any mobile visibility. For updated app users, `FMPAvailable` is an additional required gate on top of it.
