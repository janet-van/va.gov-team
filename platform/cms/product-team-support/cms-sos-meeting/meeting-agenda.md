### Meeting Purpose
This Scrum of Scrum (SoS) meeting is to ensure all teams working with the Drupal CMS for VA.gov are aligned on any shared work or dependencies.

### Running Agenda
3/16/2026

**Announcements**
- Sofia Kirkman is the new Product Lead for Drupal CMS
- Help desk is currently unavailable so updates on flagged facilities may be delayed - Sofia will work on cleaning up the Github board.
- Editors will be referred to Outlook inbox for now.


* Next Build/ Content Build development is creating some confusion and backwork - we'd like to discuss a process for communication/clarity around this 
*   This is mostly resolved. Templates have been migrated but not launched.
*   Alex talked with Kayla last week to talk about a banner.
*   There is more clarity now around which templates to migrate

* CMS Deploy time change
*   Editors have requested for CMS downtime to move to later in the day
*   We are looking to move CMS deploy to early in the morning (7am ET) or evening (6pm ET)
*   We want to avoid disruptions so we want to move it out of afternoon block
*   Coordination needs to happen between our different repos and deploy times
*   Randi: question thinking of content IA team - if it winds up being no different, 6pm may be harder if someone needs content to go out soon. Morning may be preferable.
*   Tim: main thing against morning deploy is majority of the team is MST and PST. We will be on call but we will try to prevent deployment problems. This is still a couple of months out because we are in the process of moving CMS to EKS (new containerized hosting environment) and away from BRD/Jenkins. We expect EKS to be more stable, faster, and easier to roll back if there are issues. The downtime could also go down but we still want to move it out of the way. We may not be on EKS for up to a couple of months. We want to make sure everyting is stable before we make the maintenance time shift.
*   Daniel: Feature flags and flippers being available to CMS would be helpful to coordinate releases because at the moment we don't have access to vets API flippers. We could do a better job ensuring the deployment is successful and having a rollback option. We could coordinate more carefully what we're rolling out as a team.
*   Tim: we still need a clearer idea of how to use flippers and flags to coordinate this work but we will take a look at it and see if CMS can be responsive to this work. We are hoping that this is feasible because CMS has its own feature tags. There are flags we can use in each location but it's a matter of coordinating flags between two systems. 

  
* Left Menu items
*   sitewide will own this defect. We can bring issues to biweekly template migration so things don't float into the backlog with low visibility.
  
3/2/2026
*  CMS team is cleaning up backlog and confirming [this defect](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/21263) will be owned by Public Websites team
    * Dave Picket made adjustments to the ticket
        * Added a note and put it back on the board
    * This may be a duplicate of an existing Facilities epic
        * They are going to look into this and may end up closing as duplicate
*  Regrouping about the Homepage Incident Playbook and process to contact Sitewide engineers (see thread [here](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CT4GZBM8F/p1771968916983919?thread_ts=1771514731.880499&cid=CT4GZBM8F)
    * Good to have playbook in place, but we do not anticipate these types of alerts happening after hours
    * CMS Team introduced new processes for daily deploy and smoke tests that should alleviate issue of updates being pushed after hours
    * Daniel Sasser: What is a homepage incident? What content change would necessitate reaching out to Sitewide?
        * Sitewide has an existing slack channel for monitoring of issues
        * Rotation of developers monitor those channels during business hours
        * January homepage incident displayed the page not found view
            * Static header and footer are included here
            * Homepage content was not loaded
        * Randi and Erika will need to clarify when Sitewide should be included
    * Dave Picket: There is already a process for Sitewide to be notified
        * Maybe we should include some of that in this process for homepage incidents
        * Need to include a new section for what to do in the case of after hours
    * Randi: We want to make sure we are including Sitewide contact info
        * If Erika and Randi are being pinged, we want to be clear about when it’s something for CMS vs Sitewide
    * Dave: Are the monitors specific enough for us to know which team it should go to?
        * Monitors are not perfect
    * CMS Team is expanding monitoring and adding visual regression testing (VRT) for daily deployment smoke tests
    * Overlapping of responsibilities
        * Platform Team is also related
            * Example: homepage has been down in the past due to revproxy issues
    * Grace: Sitewide is welcome to update that section of the playbook however they want, if and how Sitewide wants to be included
        * Alex will take this action item and connect with Fran and Randi to update this
*  Updates on Next Build QA template progress? Upcoming QA or launches for us to be aware of
    * New epic view here: https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1464/views/14 
        * Several templates ready for QA currently
        * Templates will be worked in this priority order
    * CMS Team is in the process of QAing VAMC Detail Page template
        * Added a sub-issue for owning team (Facilities in this case) to conduct final review and approval before moving to Production launch of the template


2/2/2026
*  CMS team is revisitng incident management for critical URLs, starting with the homepage (ticket [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/23342)). For an incidents with homepage, is there a best way that we can quickly notify a Sitewide engineer for support?
    *  CMS Team is asking for a way to contact a Sitewide Team member in the event that we need Sitewide Team expertise. Sitewide to come back with the best way to contact a person after hours by next scrum of scrums.

1/22/2026
*  Rescheduling this meeting so that more OCTO folks can join. Does Mondays work for folxs?
*  Changes to template migration process:
     - A new CMS PM will be starting on Monday (1/26) who will be taking over the PMing for template migration
     - We are going to be moving to schedule deployment of Next Build
     - We are going to be moving QAing away from staging and, likely, onto dev 

### Notes
- Reschedule meeting to Monday (avoiding 11:30am - 1pm EST)
- Kayla will be refining the structure and timing around QA
- Dave Pickett: homepage - "we've gotten through functionality and accessibility. We will be starting design. We are almost throught the first one. All of the findings were unrelated to next-build but are true in content-build. Jackie will fix this. Nothing implicates next-build or the migration work."
- CMS Will give notice to Sitewide when we switch from staging to dev
- The status of templates is scattered - we can ask Fran to get a clearer view on the status of templates.

1/08/2026
* Next Build QA
    * Next Build environments on Tugboats don't reference the content on that Tugboat ([slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C01SR56755H/p1767737279782409))
      Draft ticket to fix this problem here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/23168
    * Check in about upcoming templates that need to be QAed (see ([here](https://dsva.slack.com/lists/T03FECE8V/F0A5B9Z1HCG)))
     We will regroup about capacity during next week's template migration sync. Renata will be added to the meeting. 
    * Content Build's page-playbook.html (more details ([here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/19708)))
      Per Dave Pickett: look at the queries associated with the playbook and ask POs
 * Drupal 11 Upgrade Timeline 

12/11/2025
* Unpublished content in right-hand menu on Content Build page: https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/
    * We have seen similar issue with CB showing unpublished content previously.
    * Do we want to just publish this content since Editors and Veterans are acustomed to seeing it already?
    * [Source Slack convo](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CT4GZBM8F/p1764891158001159)
    * No POs present for SoS so Kelly to bring this to Erika and Randi
* QAing Support for Template Migration
    * Ready Now - Homepage ([Accessibility QA ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/22960) / [Functionality QA ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/22961))
  
  Can this follow the same process with Dave and Jacqueline helping with QA? - Grace has added tickets to the Sitewide board.  Fran asked for timing and Grace said Homepage can be worked asap.  Fran said soonest would be the upcoming Sprint that starts next week but it may take multiple sprints due to the holiday.  Each ticket is currently estimated at a 5 but we can discuss if that is accurate.  The CMS Team would like to have a kick-off meeting when QA is started so we can show the QA tools we have available.  
  
    * Ready after 1/7/2026 - Benefit Detail Page ([Accessibility QA ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/22966) / [Functionality QA Ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/22965)) and VAMC Detail Page ([Accessibility QA ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/22864) / [Functionality QA Ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/22865)) - Fran to share this QA plan with Renata for the VAMC Detail Page coming up.
* CMS team will be picking up [Migration: Outreach Hub landing page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/20544) and [Migration: Outreach Hub Publications listing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/20590) - Sitewide is working a change to a data structure the Publication Listing page uses.  CMS Team will communicate with Dave from Sitewide on timing of this change.

* Burial & Memorials URL Redirect - Sofia asked Fran what the steps are that the CMS Team will need to do.  
* Steps needed
  - Updating side nav - done by CMS Team
  - Updating best bets
  - Updating crosslinks
* Fran is going to check and follow-up with Sofia
* We do not have this process documented so we have a lot of open questions around ETA of a fix
  * Fran to enhance the issue template with steps



11/26/2025
* [Flagged Facilities](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1859/views/1)
    * tickets have been updated
    * Update to URL publishing process
        * Publishing the URL Redirect before the URL of the Facility in Drupal causes less time for the page to be a 404 so we will be updating the runbook and Mural diagram to match this change.
    * Setting up a Flagged Facility touchpoint since that is a different audience
       * Item to add: touch base on the current tickets and make sure they are ready for handoffs
       * Set up cadence for once a sprint
       * Kelly will reach out to Renata and Alex and keep Michelle and Jon as optional
       * Sitewide facilities will create the alias and let CMS team know via GH ticket and Slack (and update the status of the ticket)

* Henrico 2 - if we archive a page for a Facility that still comes back from the Facility Locator, how does it behave?
    * Facility does not need to be published to have an operating status
    * Archive the page and mark with 'Coming Soon', add to details to say it is a dental clinic that is not yet open

  

10/30/2025
* Flagged Facilities - we will talk specifics about process on Monday but want to check in on if there are any outstanding items

Anything else that was outstanding from the Sitewide team? Renata -- we still have a few questions that we will raise on Monday's meeting. We have a few tickets that are blocked because the new URLs haven't and can't be published during the shutdown. 
Action item: Renata will send Kelly the blocked tickets. Kelly will explore adding a new board to house both tickets. 

* Benfits detail pages - I saw there was work planned for PW, as a reminder these are in the middle of migrating and will be completed within the next 2 sprints

There's no immediate work, the work is in the future and will only be in Drupal. Fran will coordinate with Laura is there's any immediate issues that comes up with benefit details pages. 

* CLPs - There are instances of Draft content currently showing on prod, what should we do?

There are draft promos that are getting published on campaign landing pages. Randi will spot check the draft promos to make sure there's nothing terribly wrong with them and then published the draft promos. 

* Sidenav? Maybe, depends on attendees

Reverse the original decision.
