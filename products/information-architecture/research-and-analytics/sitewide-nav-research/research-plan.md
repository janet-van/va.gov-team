product_area: "unauthenticated"

# Background Context
background:  
  problem_statement: "As VA.gov expands in features and benefits-related content, visitors need to be able to navigate the site efficiently to find the right information and tools; this research evaluates the effectiveness of the current navigation labels and organization for key tasks and whether proposed top-level changes improve findability."
  product_location: "VA.gov sitewide primary navigation (available across the entire site) and secondary navigation within the benefit hub experience."
  user_familiarity: "Iteration on an existing navigation experience (evaluating existing navigation; considering updates such as adding 'My VA' and 'My HealtheVet' to top-level navigation)."
  product_brief_url: "Not specified"

# Research Design
methodology: "tree test (unmoderated)"
research_format: 
  location: remote # Options: remote, in-person, hybrid
  moderated: false # Options: true, false
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "`1.` Assess whether users can find key information related to top tasks on the site easily and with confidence."
  - goal_2: "`2.` Determine if the labels used in navigation meet the mental model of our users."
  - goal_3: "`3.` Determine if adding "My VA" and My HealtheVet" to the top level of navigation impacts findability of tools related to managing benefits."

research_questions:
  - "`1.` Can users easily find information related to applying for key benefits?"
  - "`2.` Can users easily find key tools that help them manage benefits they are already receiving?"
  - "`3.` Is there a difference in findability between tools that align with a single benefit versus those that support multiple benefits?"

hypotheses:
  - "`1.` Users will be able to easily find key information related to learning about and applying for key Veteran benefits within their respective benefit hubs."
  - "`2.` Users will look to the family member and caregiver benefit hub to find key information related to benefits for family members."
  - "`3.` Users will not commonly look to the Service member benefits hub as a destination for key Veteran benefit information and tools."
  - "`4.` Users will most commonly look in "My VA" and My HealtheVet" as ways to get to tools to manage their benefits."

expected_outcomes: "Findings will inform and help prioritize changes to navigation/menu labels, groupings, and/or broader site organization to improve findability of key tasks, benefits information, and benefit-management tools."

# Research Plan for OCTO IA, Sitewide IA and Navigation, March 2026


## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

As VA.gov continues to expand in features and content related to benefits, we need to ensure visitors can navigate the site to find the right information.  This research will evaluate the effectiveness of the organization and labeling in the key navigation components usedin the VA.gov benefit experience - the primary navigation menu in the header (labeled VA benefits and health care) and the secondary navigation in the benefit hub space shown in the left rail on desktop and in a drop list on mobile.  This research effort will not evaluate the design or interactions of those components, only the organization and labeling.
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

Primary navigation is available to all users across the entire site.  Secondary naviation is available to all users within the benefit hub experience.
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

From Jan 1, 2025 - Sept 30, 2025 there were 10.7M searches submitted and 12.7M clicks on the "VA Benefits and Health care menu option.

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

- `1.` Assess whether users can find key information related to top tasks on the site easily and with confidence.
- `2.` Determine if the labels used in navigation meet the mental model of our users.
- `3.` Determine if adding "My VA" and My HealtheVet" to the top level of navigation impacts findability of tools related to managing benefits.


  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

Outcomes from this research will be used to inform and prioritize changes needed to menu labels, groupings, or broader site organization.



### Research questions
	
#### Goal 1: Assess whether users can find key information related to top tasks on the site easily and with confidence
- `1.` Can users easily find information related to applying for key benefits?
- `2.` Can users easily find key tools that help them manage benefits they are already receiving?
- `3.` Is there a difference in findability between tools that align with a single benefit versus those that support multiple benefits?

#### Goal 2: Determine if the labels used in navigation meet the mental model of our users.
- `4.` Where do users look for information related to benefits for a Veteran family member or caregiver?
- `5.` Is the Service member benefits hub a common destination for key tasks related to Veteran benefits?
- `6.` Are Veterans able to determine which hub contains information related to the VR&E program?

#### Goal 3: Determine if adding "My VA" and My HealtheVet" to the top level of navigation impacts findability of tools related to managing those benefits.
- `7.` Is "My VA" a common pathway to tools related to managing benefits?
- `8.` Is "My HealtheVet" a common pathway to tools related to managing health care?


### Hypotheses

- `1.` Users will be able to easily find key information related to learning about and applying for key Veteran benefits within their respective benefit hubs. 
- `2.` Users will look to the family member and caregiver benefit hub to find key information related to benefits for family members.
- `3.` Users will not commonly look to the Service member benefits hub as a destination for key Veteran benefit information and tools. 
- `4.` Users will most commonly look in "My VA" and My HealtheVet" as ways to get to tools to manage their benefits.

  
## Methodology  🛠️
***Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.*** 

A tree test will be used to evaluate the existing navigation component organization and labels. The tree used in the test will reflect the labels and organizational structure that visitors must navigate through to get to content and tools within the benefit experience.  Participants will be asked to completed 10 tasks based on the most commonly accessed information and tools on the site.
