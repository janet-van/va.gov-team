# Research Plan for Platypus Tools Team: Documentation Research Round 2

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
    - The Platypus Platform Tools team.
    - The product is the Platform documentation.
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 
    - The Platypus Tools team has been working to organize, improve, and categorize the wide range of documentation that we have amassed to enable teams to design and build products for VA.gov.
    - At the end of March 2019, we conducted a usability study on our documentation to learn if people unfamiliar with the project can find what they are looking for. The results of that study can be found [here](link).
    - We used the input from that study to make significant changes to the current documentation repo, and we plan to test these changes in this study. These changes include:
          - Organizing the content into three main buckets: 
		- Administrative (for general information about work practices and organizational culture)
		- Practice Areas - information about how each specific practice area works
		- Products - information about the digital products and services built on va.gov.
	- Adding a table of contents to each practice area readme
	- Rewriting the main vets.gov-team readme
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 
    - Can members of a cross-functional product development team with no prior experience working on VA.gov find the information they need to deliver successful products on VA.gov?
    - If a contractor has a question, can they find the answer in the documentation?
    	- If they cannot find the answer, do they know who to contact?
    - Can participants find a direct path to their specific practice area’s folder without help?
    - Do participants have a sense of the overall purpose of the project, and their place in it?
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
    - We anticipate that the changes we have made to the documentation will enable participants to quickly find information particular to their practice area, and that they will feel empowered to start making contributions right away.    
## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 
     - Moderated, in-person usability.
  
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
     - We would like to be able to observe the steps people take as they navigate the documentation, and ask them questions throughout the sessions about their thought processes, stress levels, emotional states, etc. 

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
     - In person at the Ad Hoc annual retreat.

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* \
  - We will be testing markdown files hosted here in GitHub:
    - [Main repo readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team)
    - Practice area readme’s:
      - [Accessibility](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/README.md)
      - [Content](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/content/README.md)
      - [Design](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/README.md)
      - [Engineering](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/README.md)
          - [Backend](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/backend/README.md)
          - [Frontend](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/frontend/readme.md)
          - [Infrastructure](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/infrastructure/readme.md)
      - [Information Architecture](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/README.md)

          - [Analytics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/google-analytics/readme.md)
          - [Contact Center](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/contact-center/README.md)
      - [Product](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/README.md)

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
     - 10-12 participants
     - An even mix of men and women
     - Veteran/Servicemember status is _not_ required
     - Ideally, at least one participant from each practice area: Accessibility, Content, Design, Backend Engineering, Frontend Engineering, Infrastructure, IA, Analytics, Product, QA, and Research.
     - The participants should not work on a VA.gov product team, and ideally have not previously worked on VA.gov.
     - The participants should have little to no familiarity with the product development process on VA.gov.

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
     - We will set up a guerrilla-style research station during the Ad Hoc science fair to recruit people as they are passing by.

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?
    - Each session should be about 10 minutes long.

4.	Schedule: TBD
