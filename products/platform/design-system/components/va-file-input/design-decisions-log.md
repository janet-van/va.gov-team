## ADR 001 - Limiting the built-in functionality for encrypted and password protected files

### Status: Proposed

- Date issue raised: 07/17/2025
- Decision date: 07/17/2025

### Context
Teams wanting to implement the `va-file-input` web component often need support for encrypted and password protected files. However, the current implementation of `va-file-input` does not determine if a file is encrypted nor does it decrypt the file. This has been a surprise for some teams who expected an all-in-one solution.

### Decision
The `va-file-input` web component will support setting the `encrypted` property to `true` when the user needs to supply a password. This will display a password field. This password can be retrieved through the `vaPasswordChange` event. All additional functionality related to decrypting the file or using the provided password will need to be handled by the individual team.

This decision has been made because of the development principle to build components that decouple business requirements from the standardized UI and to keep the web component as "DRY" as possible which will allow for a more flexible and maintainable component. Each integration could potentially have a different approach or use case for how they need to handle encrypted and password protected files and the web component should not try to create a single solution for all of those situations. The VA Design System Team [performed research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/3601) that revealed there are unique ways to handle encryption. This principle also promotes modularity and allows different parts of an application to be developed, tested, and updated independently. 

Other considerations include the fact that the majority of file related logic should live server side vs client side, which is where the file will likely be stored and processed.

Additionally, the VA Design System component-library is used in a number of different products and services, and we want to ensure that the component can accommodate the needs of all.

For this reason, VA.gov Platform will provide standardized and centralized utility functions that live in `vets-website`, primarily for usage in forms, that will give a basic implementation of how to handle encryption and password protected files.

### Consequences
Teams will need to leverage centralized platform utilities for handling the detection and submissions of encrypted and password protected files. If they require further customization, they will need to implement their own solution and potentially offer that solution back to the platform or forms library for other VFS teams to use.

## ADR 002 - Display static thumbnail for PDF files

### Status: Accepted

- Date issue raised: 11/14/2025
- Decision date: 11/20/2025

### Context
While doing accessibility testing on the file input components, it was observed that sometimes when loading a multi-paged PDF, the PDF file preview would allow you to scroll through the pages of the PDF, and if you clicked on the thumbnail some screen readers would announce more details about the PDF. This behavior is inconsistent, and not all PDFs show a preview like this.

### Decision
The preview image size for the uploaded file is only 40px x 40px. It is impossible to distinguish the content of the file. There was no documentation left about why the previous decision was to show this as a feature. But we have decided to just show a static, generic svg file in its place.

### Consequences
If there was any chance that users were hoping to verify they uploaded the right file via the preview, at such a small size, that functionality is now removed.

## **ADR 003 \- Password Encryption**
 
**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 09/2025

### Context

Users occasionally need to upload password-protected files, particularly encrypted PDFs, as part of their applications. The `va-file-input` web component needed a mechanism to collect passwords for encrypted files without handling the actual decryption logic.

#### Key requirements include:

* Providing a user interface for password entry when encrypted files are uploaded  
* Maintaining separation of concerns between the web component (presentation) and business logic (decryption/processing)  
* Securely transmitting passwords to the backend for file decryption  
* Supporting the forms library's file processing workflow

The challenge was determining where password collection, transmission, and file decryption responsibilities should reside within the platform architecture.

### **Decision**

We have decided to implement a distributed approach to handling password-protected files:

#### **Web Component (va-file-input)**

The `va-file-input` web component will support an `encrypted` property. When set to `true`:

* A password input field will be displayed to the user  
* The password is masked  
* Password changes will be emitted through the `vaPasswordChange` event  
* The component will NOT handle any decryption or password validation logic

#### **Forms Library**

The forms library will be responsible for:

* Capturing the password from the `vaPasswordChange` event  
* Validating the password decrypts the PDF  
* Transmitting the password securely to the backend along with the file


#### **Backend**

The backend will handle:

* Receiving the encrypted file and associated password  
* Decrypting the file using the provided password  
* Validating the decryption was successful  
* Processing the decrypted file for submission

#### **PDF Encryption Specifically**

For PDF files with encryption:

* The forms library sends both the file and password to the backend  
* The backend decrypts the PDF before final submission  
* If decryption fails, the backend returns an appropriate error

## ADR 004 - File Type Validation

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 09/2025

### Context

The `va-file-input` component is designed as a presentation component and does not handle business logic such as file type validation. As applications using this component need to validate uploaded files for security and data integrity, a decision was needed on where to implement file type validation logic.

Key validation requirements include:

* Detecting mismatches between file extensions and actual MIME types (e.g., a PDF file renamed with a `.png` extension)  
* Validating UTF encoding for text-based files  
* Supporting both single and multi-file upload patterns

Without centralized validation logic, each application would need to implement its own validation, leading to inconsistent error handling and duplicate code across the platform.

### Decision

We have decided to implement file type validation logic in the forms library rather than in the `va-file-input` web component itself.

The forms library will provide validation for:

1. MIME type and file extension matching \- Ensures the file's actual format matches its declared extension  
2. UTF encoding validation \- Verifies proper character encoding for text files

This validation will be available for both:

* [Single file input pattern](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/platform/forms-system/src/js/web-component-patterns/fileInputPattern.jsx)  
* [Multi-file input pattern](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/platform/forms-system/src/js/web-component-patterns/fileInputMultiplePattern.jsx)

### Standard Error Messages

The following standardized error messages will be displayed:

* UTF encoding error: "The file's encoding is not valid"  
* MIME type/extension mismatch: "The file extension doesn't match the file format. Please choose a different file."

### Custom Error Handling outside of forms library

Applications requiring custom error handling outside the forms library can refer to the [implementation example in the DS v3 playground](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/ds-v3-playground/pages/VaFileInputMultiple.jsx).


## ADR 005 - Display read-only data via dt instead of inert

**Status**: Accepted

**Decision Date**: 03/10/2026

### Context

`va-file-input` and `va-file-input-multiple` allow users to upload a file and assign it a document type (e.g. "Birth certificate", "Utility bill") via a `<select>` element in the slot. Once the file is uploaded and enters a review state, the document type selection becomes immutable — the user can no longer change it.

Previously, the review state applied the `inert` attribute to the `<select>` to prevent interaction. While inert correctly removes the element from tab order and blocks pointer interaction, it also removes the element from the accessibility tree entirely. Screen reader users receive no indication that a document type was selected or what that value is.
This is a WCAG 2.2 failure under:

* 1.3.1 Info and Relationships — the selected value is not conveyed to AT
* 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value — the value of the control is not exposed

### Decision
In the review state of `va-file-input` and `va-file-input-multiple`, replace the inert-disabled `<select>` with a `<dl>` displaying the document type label and the user's selected value.

```
<dl>
  <dt>Document type</dt>
  <dd>[User-selected document type label]</dd>
</dl>
```

This pattern is scoped to the file card context. It is not a general-purpose read-only select pattern for other components or use cases.

### Rationale

Why not keep `<select>` in a disabled or read-only state?

`<select>` has no native readonly attribute. The available alternatives each carry a meaningful cost:

* **inert** — removes the element from the accessibility tree. AT users cannot perceive the value. Not acceptable.
* **disabled** — semantically incorrect here. disabled signals the field is unavailable for interaction, not that the user already made a confirmed choice. It also excludes the value from form submission, requiring a hidden input workaround. AT announces it as "dimmed" or "unavailable," which misrepresents the state.
* **aria-disabled + pointer-events**: none — does not reliably prevent keyboard interaction. AT can still open the select in some browser/AT combos.
* **aria-readonly** — not a valid ARIA property on listbox or combobox roles. Silently ignored by AT.

None of these correctly communicate "this is a confirmed, immutable value the user previously set."

#### Why `<dl>`?

In the review state, the document type is no longer a form input — it is a confirmed data point associated with a specific file. A description list is semantically appropriate for a label/value pair and is well-supported across AT/browser combinations.

The `<dl>` pattern:

* Announces correctly in both browse mode and when navigated to directly
* Requires no ARIA overrides
* Accurately represents the information architecture: this is a fact about the file, not an editable field
* Is consistent with how other confirmed metadata is displayed in card/summary contexts

#### Why not `<dl>` everywhere?

This decision is intentionally scoped. Read-only select states elsewhere in VADS (e.g. system-controlled field locks, partially editable forms) have different semantic requirements and must be evaluated independently.

#### Where else are we using `<dl>` today?

The same pattern can be found in a forms review page, that displays static content of entered data. The same use case here.



### Consequences**

#### Positive

* Screen reader users can now perceive the confirmed document type value
* Eliminates WCAG 1.3.1 and 4.1.2 failures in the review state
* No ARIA workarounds or hidden input hacks required
* Pattern is stable across AT/browser combinations

#### Negative / watch items

* The visual and interaction pattern shifts from a form control to static content — consuming teams should ensure the surrounding UI makes the review state clear to sighted users as well
* If the component ever needs to support editing the document type after upload (inline edit pattern), the `<dl>` approach will need to be revisited in favor of a toggled edit state
* JAWS in forms mode will skip `<dl>` content — acceptable here since the review state is not inside an active form submission context, but should be verified if that assumption changes
* DL/DT is not nicely announced using voice over on chrome. This use case may not also be a true representation of a definition for a term.  More exploration is encouraged, but this is the state as of today 3/10/2026.


## ADR 006 - Make available older password version for claim-status team only

**Status**: Accepted

**Decision Date**: 03/18/2026

### Context

The `claim-status` tool team is asking for a change to va-file-input with the password enhancement as their backend and front end are not set up to handle the additional button. 

`claim-status` uses the `va-file-input-multiple` component outside of the forms-system. In contrast to the form-system, `claim-status` does not immediately upload files. A user will add multiple files, specify file type, and add a password (if relevant) then upload all files together.

Unlike the forms-system there is no debouncing or delayed action taken after a user types a password. Meaning that right now the accessibility issues with the forms-system implementation of an encrypted pdf upload may not exist.

For `claim-status` to use the new design of the file-input (which requires immediate file upload) the `claim-status` team would have to re-architect their front end and modify their backend significantly.

### Decision
We decided to re-implement the updates to `va-file-input` and `va-file-input-multiple` that introduced the new password submit button pattern from PR #1997, while adding backward compatibility for the existing pattern that uses only a password text input and emits `vaPasswordChange`.

Backward compatibility is supported through a new `disablePasswordSubmitPattern` prop (default: false) on both components. When this prop is false, the password section renders a submit button, emits `vaPasswordSubmit` on button click, and uses updated event-handler logic. When this prop is true, there is no rendered submit button. This is the version that we are making available to `claim-status`.

Under the hood, the teams using this version (should just be claims status tool) would still listen to the `vaPasswordChange` event and use that in their own business logic to
determine if the password is correct or not. We will test against vets-website, but none of these changes should be breaking for existing implementations.

Because we do not want other teams setting `disablePasswordSubmitPattern` to true, we are not displaying it as an option in Figma or VADS. The `claim-status` tool is the only approved consumer of `disablePasswordSubmitPattern="true"`.

### Rationale
The `claim-status` version relies on implicit submit to determine if the password is successful or not. This can cause some accessibility issues if teams don't implement it correctly. We would rather give the user control of when the submit action takes place through the use of a submit button. But, because of the work that it would take the `claim-status` tool to refactor their code and processes, we've granted them an exception. 

### Consequences
More teams may want to set `disablePasswordSubmitButtonPattern` to true now that we have one product using it. But we will have to evaluate each use case.
