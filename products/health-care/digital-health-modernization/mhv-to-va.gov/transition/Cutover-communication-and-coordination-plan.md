# Michigan Cutover Weekend Communication & Coordination Plan
**Go-Live Date:** April 11, 2025 | **Anticipated all clear:** 7:00 AM ET

---

## Communication Channels

### Primary Internal Channel
**Slack: `#mhv-april-go-live-tiger-team`**
This is the primary channel for internal OCTO/VA.gov team coordination throughout the cutover weekend. All task updates, status confirmations, and issue escalations should be posted here.

### Oracle Health/EHRM Bridge Line (External)
A team member representative (to be determined) will be invited to the Oracle-led bridge line. OCTO is finalizing who will liaise via this external channel.

## Communication Protocol: How to Report Task Status

For every task listed below, the responsible team member should post **two updates** in `#mhv-april-go-live-tiger-team`:

1. **▶️ STARTED** — Post when you begin executing a task
   > Example: `▶️ STARTED | T-0 | Running sign-up service job for Michigan SM patients | [Name]`

2. **✅ COMPLETE** — Post when the task is fully finished and confirmed
   > Example: `✅ COMPLETE | T-0 | Sign-up service job done. is_messageable flag verified set for Michigan patients | [Name]`

If a task encounters a problem or delay, post immediately:
> `🚨 ISSUE | T-0 | [Brief description of problem] | [Name] — escalating to [contact]`

For tasks that also need to be reported out on the **Oracle bridge line**, the person responsible should post in Slack first, then coordinate with POC to report on the bridge line.

### April 11 (T-0)

This is the highest-coordination period. All updates go to Slack **and** the Oracle Health/ EHRM Bridge line as appropriate.

| Time (ET) | Task | Team | Report In |
|---|---|---|---|
| **12:15 AM** | Activate Oracle Health triage groups | SM API | Slack |
| **7:00 AM** | **ALL CLEAR — Go-live confirmed** | Oracle Health| Bridge line → Slack |

## Validation

Once the interface is live, a production validation step is required to officially mark VA.gov as **"Operational"** in the Oracle cutover dashboard. This is tracked in the Oracle cutover plan as a "Production Validation" step.

- VA.gov/OCTO will use **trusted users** (VA staff who are also Veterans at Michigan facilities - already identified) to validate that the experience is working as expected after go-live
- Once validated, report **✅ VALIDATED — VA.gov operational** in Slack and on the bridge line
- Larry Thorne can assist with tagging this step in the Oracle cutover plan so it reflects as validated on the dashboard
