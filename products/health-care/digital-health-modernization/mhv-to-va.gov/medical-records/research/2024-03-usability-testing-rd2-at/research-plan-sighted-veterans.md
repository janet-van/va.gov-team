# **Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medical Records, March 2024 - Sighted Participants**

## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We initially built and tested a prototype of the Medical Records in MHV on VA.gov. We conducted a usability study and collected feedback that informed reiterations on the website. In this round of usability testing within a live environment, we will assess (1) whether the updates improve user experiences, and (2) test additional and new functionality, (3) include Veterans who require accessibility provisions and explore further pain points.

You can read more about our Digital Health Modernization strategy [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product).

**OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

**Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## **Research Goals**

1. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience in accessing their Care Summaries and Notes, Vaccines, Allergies, and Vitals records.
    - Identify what information Veterans expect to see within the detail view. 
    - Identify if Veterans understand the information presented in the list and detail views. 
2. Identify if Veterans know how to print/download both an individual record and list of records.
3. Identify any barriers that may prevent Veterans who have mild to severe Cognitive Disabilities from completing their Medical Records management goals.

## **Research Questions**

1. Can Veterans find the information they need to manage their health related to:
     - Care summaries and notes
     - Allergies
     - Vaccines
     - Vitals

2. Can Veterans print/download a list and an individual record?

3. What is Veterans' perception of the new experience in which they can view their records on screen?

## **Hypothesis**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their ‘Vaccinations’ records to manage their health.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their ‘Allergies & reactions’ records to manage their health.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their “Care Summaries & Notes” to manage their health.

_Hypothesis 4_: Most Veterans will be able to access and understand the information about their “Vitals” to manage their health.

_Hypothesis 5:_ Most Veterans will find the information presented in their Medical Records adequate for managing their health.

## **Methodology**

We will conduct moderated usability testing sessions in which we will ask users to navigate a prototype while we observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

**Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
