# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand how veterans conceptualize 'new' or 'recent' in medical records (time-based window)"
  - goal_2: "Evaluate whether landing page indicators + list page badges help veterans find recent results"
 
research_questions:
  - "How do veterans define 'new' or 'recent' when thinking about medical records? (7 days? 14 days? 30 days?)"
  - "Do landing page cards showing counts of new results provide helpful orientation before entering lists?"
  - "Are badges on list pages sufficient to identify new items, or is additional information needed?"
  - "What information do veterans need on landing page cards to decide where to click?"
  - "Does the 'breadcrumb' approach (landing page card → list page with badges → detail page) work for finding recent results?"

hypotheses:
  - "Veterans will prefer a time-based window of 7-14 days for 'new' indicators"
  - "Landing page cards showing counts will help veterans orient to where new results are located"
  - "Minimal information on cards (type + count) will be sufficient for navigation"

expected_outcomes: "Findings will inform the design of recency indicators for MVP release. We'll learn the optimal time window, required card content, and whether the breadcrumb navigation approach supports findability."

# Research Plan for MHV Medical Records: Notification Usability Study - March 2026

## Background 🏗️

**What problem is your product trying to solve?**

Veterans struggle to find their most recent medical records results after being notified they're available. Current issues include:
- No clear indicators for "new" or "recent" results
- Imaging buried within Labs & Tests, forcing manual scanning
- Information overload on list pages
- Unclear which category contains new information

This results in veterans:
- Clicking through multiple pages to find one new result
- Calling help desk for support (13.1% of Medallia tasks)
- Feeling frustrated and overwhelmed (42% of Medallia complaints)

**Where is your product situated on VA.gov?**

VA.gov > My Health > Medical Records (authenticated experience)

**What is Veterans' familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?**

Iteration on existing Medical Records product. Veterans are familiar with accessing records online, but findability problems worsened after the 2025 platform switchover.

**Product Brief**

- [VA.gov Generative Research (2022-2025)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/research/2022-10_Generative-research/2022-11-medical-records-readout.md) - Identified appointments, facilities, and conditions as natural anchors
- Medallia Feedback Analysis (Q3-Q4 2025) - Documented sharp rise in "can't find" complaints post-platform switch

**Key Takeaways from Previous Research:**
- Veterans struggle with mixed grouping and navigation (imaging buried in Labs)
- They want search and filtering tools (most explicit feature request)
- Information overload is a major pain point, especially on mobile
- Veterans think in terms of appointments/facilities/conditions, not document types
- Uncertainty about record completeness erodes trust

### OCTO-DE Priorities

**Objective 3: Relentlessly improve the user experience**
- **Key Result 3.1:** Supports this product’s OIT portfolio (Health, Benefits, etc) in improving customer satisfaction (or similar measure of user experience quality) of impactful systems by 3% or more.

- **Key Result 3.2:** 100% of end-user facing C100 systems maintain a ranked list of user pain points.
  - *Research Ops Plain Language: Supports maintaining the ranked list of user pain points for Veteran-facing Products and Services.*
  
- **Key Result 3.3:** 100% of C-100 systems have delivered at least one release that directly addresses a documented user pain point with that system.
  - *Research Ops Plain Language: Supports the delivery of at least one release that directly addresses a documented user pain point within this product.*

---

### Veteran Journey

**Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey?**

- `Taking Care of Myself` - Managing ongoing health conditions, following up on test results
- `Aging` - Increased medical complexity, more frequent health monitoring

---

## Research Goals 🥅

### Goals

**1.Understand how veterans conceptualize "new" or "recent" in medical records**

Learn what time window feels right (7 days? 14 days? 30 days?) and whether time-based indicators match their mental model.

**2. Evaluate whether landing page indicators + list page badges help veterans find recent results**

Test the "breadcrumb" approach: landing page cards with counts → list pages with badges → detail pages.

**3. Identify what information veterans need on cards and badges**

Determine minimal vs. optimal content for landing page cards and list page indicators.

---

### Outcome

**How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process?**

This research will inform the design and engineering of MVP 1 + MVP 2 for production release. Specifically, we'll learn:
- The optimal time window for "new" indicators (engineering parameter)
- Required content for landing page cards (design specification)
- Whether the breadcrumb navigation approach supports findability (design validation)

Findings will directly inform the production release addressing Use Case #1: Following Up on Recent Care (prioritized based on 3.23M page views and 42% of Medallia complaints).

---

### Research questions

**1. How do veterans define "new" or "recent" when thinking about medical records?**
- Is 7 days too short? 14 days? 30 days?
- When a badge persists after viewing, is that helpful (reminder) or confusing (feels stale)?
- What happens when the indicator goes away—is that okay or confusing?

**2. Do landing page cards showing counts of new results provide helpful orientation?**
- Do they help veterans know where to look first?
- Or do they feel like unnecessary extra clicks?
- When veterans see "You have 2 new lab results," does that help them know where to go?
- Does the card help connect to indicators on the list?

**3. What information do veterans need on landing page cards?**
- Is just the count enough ("2 new results")?
- Do they need dates ("Added in last 7 days")?
- Do they need specificity ("Chemistry Panel, Complete Blood Count")?
- Do they need categories? 

**4. Are badges on list pages sufficient to identify new items?**
- What makes a badge noticeable vs. easy to miss?
- What additional context helps (dates, "RECENT" label, icon)?

**5. Does the breadcrumb approach work for finding recent results?**
- Landing page card → list page → detail page
- Is this flow intuitive or frustrating?

---

### Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1:** Veterans will prefer a time-based window of 7-14 days for "new" indicators, as this aligns with typical follow-up timelines after appointments.

**Hypothesis 2:** Landing page cards showing counts ("You have 2 new lab results") will provide helpful orientation, reducing aimless clicking through categories.

**Hypothesis 3:** Minimal information on cards (record type + count + time frame) will be sufficient for navigation. Veterans don't need individual record names on landing page.

**Hypothesis 4:** Badges on list pages will be more effective than landing page cards alone, as they provide specific identification of new items.

---

## Methodology 🛠️

**Moderated usability testing with concept exploration**

This method is appropriate because:
- We have a testable prototype (high-fidelity) showing the proposed approach
- We need to evaluate whether the design supports findability (evaluative)
- We want to understand mental models around "recency" (exploratory)
- The product is in the design phase, ready for concept validation before build
