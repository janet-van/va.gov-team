# Research Plan for MHV Medical Records: Recency Indicators Usability Study - March 2026

## Background 🏗️

**What problem is your product trying to solve?**

Veterans struggle to find their most recent medical records results after being notified they're available. Medical records access represents 13.1% of all Medallia contacts, indicating this is a high-volume, high-friction area.

Current issues include:
- No clear indicators for "new" or "recent" results
- Imaging buried within Labs & Tests, forcing manual scanning
- Information overload on list pages
- Unclear which category contains new information

This results in Veterans:
- Clicking through multiple pages to find one new result
- Feeling frustrated and overwhelmed (42% of Medallia complaints)

**Where is your product situated on VA.gov?**

VA.gov > My Health > Medical Records (authenticated experience)

**What is Veterans' familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?**

Iteration on existing Medical Records product. Veterans are familiar with accessing records online, but findability problems worsened after the 2025 platform switchover.

- Medallia Feedback Analysis (Q3-Q4 2025) - Documented sharp rise in "can't find" complaints post-platform switch (90% volume increase in complaint count)

**Key Takeaways from Previous Research:**
- Some Veterans struggle with mixed grouping and navigation (imaging buried in Labs)
- Some express wanting search and filtering tools (most explicit feature request)
- Information overload is a major pain point, especially on mobile
- Some Veterans think in terms of appointments/facilities/conditions, not document types
- Uncertainty about record completeness erodes trust

- **Key Result 3.2:** Supports maintaining the ranked list of user pain points for Veteran-facing Products and Services.

- **Key Result 3.3:** Supports the delivery of at least one release that directly addresses a documented user pain point within this product.

---

### Veteran Journey

**Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey?**

- `Taking Care of Myself` - Managing ongoing health conditions, following up on test results
- `Aging` - Increased medical complexity, more frequent health monitoring

---

## Research Goals 🥅

### Goals

**1. Understand how Veterans conceptualize "new" or "recent" in medical records**

Learn what time window feels right (7 days? 14 days? 30 days?) and whether time-based indicators match their mental model.

**2. Evaluate whether landing page indicators + list page badges help Veterans find recent results**

Test the "breadcrumb" approach: landing page cards with counts → list pages with badges → detail pages.

**3. Identify what information Veterans need on cards and badges**

Determine minimal vs. optimal content for landing page cards and list page indicators.

**4. Assess whether Veterans can discover and use the updated date filter to find specific past results.**

Evaluate whether the accordion-style date filter is discoverable, intuitive, and effective when Veterans need to locate a specific historical record, and identify any interaction barriers that could signal accessibility concerns.

---

### Outcome

**How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process?**

This research will inform the design and engineering of MVP 1 + MVP 2 for production release. Specifically, we'll learn:
- The optimal time window for "new" indicators (engineering parameter)
- Required content for landing page cards (design specification)
- Whether the breadcrumb navigation approach supports findability (design validation)
- Whether the updated accordion date filter is discoverable and usable for finding historical results (accessibility pattern validation)

Findings will directly inform the production release addressing Use Case #1: Following Up on Recent Care (prioritized based on 3.23M page views and 42% of Medallia complaints).

### Research questions

**RQ1: What characteristics signal "new" or "recent" to Veterans in their medical records?**
- What do Veterans care about that tells them something is new or recent?
- Is it time-based (7 days, 14 days, 30 days)? Event-based (since my appointment)? User-based (since I last looked)?
- When something is marked as "recent" but they've already seen it, is that helpful (reminder) or confusing (feels stale)?

> Maps to: Task 1 (recency mental model probes on list page), Task 2 (time window exploration)

**RQ2: What navigation tactics help Veterans orient themselves to new information?**
- Do counts of new results help them understand where to look? ("You have 2 new lab results")
- What else helps them orient themselves to what's new?
- What navigation patterns reduce cognitive load when scanning for recent items?

> Maps to: Task 2 (landing page entry), Task 2.5 (Recent Results section structure)

**RQ3: What information helps Veterans orient, navigate, and understand new medical records?**
- What helps them decide where to click?
- What reduces information overload?
- Is summary information enough, or do they need specific details upfront?

> Maps to: Task 2 (exploration of card content), Task 2.5 (section structure)

**RQ4: What types of visual information help Veterans identify what's new?**
- Do badges, dates, sorting, or other visual cues help them understand what's new?
- What combination of visual communication (icons, hierarchy, labels) helps them scan quickly?
- Where do their eyes go first when looking for new items?

> Maps to: Task 1 (observing scanning behavior on landing page and list page), Task 1.5 (badge labeling and visual cue discussion)

**RQ5: Can Veterans connect information presented in different contexts?**
- Do Veterans recognize the same information when presented on a landing page vs. a list page? (Recognition and recall)
- Does seeing a summary ("2 new results") help them identify those items on a detail list?
- Do they notice connections between information in different places, or does each page feel isolated?

> Maps to: Task 1 (landing page card → list page flow, context transfer question), Task 1.5 (partial coverage understanding, trust & confidence)

**RQ6: Can Veterans use the updated filter pattern to locate specific past results?**
- Can they discover the filter control without prompting?
- Is the accordion interaction intuitive?
- Do the date range options match how they think about past care?
- Are there interaction barriers that suggest accessibility concerns?

> Maps to: Task 3 (filter discovery, accordion usability, date-range selection)

---

### Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1:** Veterans will prefer a time-based window of 7-14 days for "Recent" indicators, as this aligns with typical follow-up timelines after appointments.

**Hypothesis 2:** Landing page cards showing counts ("You have 2 new lab results") will provide helpful orientation, reducing aimless clicking through categories.

**Hypothesis 3:** Minimal information on cards (record type + count + time frame) will be sufficient for navigation. Veterans don't need individual record names on landing page.

**Hypothesis 4:** "Recent" Badges on list pages will be more effective than landing page cards alone, as they provide specific identification of new items.

**Hypothesis 5:** Veterans will be able to use the accordion filter to narrow results by date range, but may need a moment to discover the control. Once found, the interaction will be completable without assistance for most participants.

---

## Methodology 🛠️

**Moderated usability testing with concept exploration**

This method is appropriate because:
- We have a testable prototype (high-fidelity) showing the proposed approach
- We need to evaluate whether the design supports findability (evaluative)
- We want to understand mental models around "recency" (exploratory)
- The product is in the design phase, ready for concept validation before build

The filter task evaluates a pattern change from dropdown to accordion for date filtering. This task provides a preliminary usability signal on the updated accessible pattern.

We will use a **GitHub Codespace** (coded prototype) instead of Figma because Figma is not accessible to screen readers. The coded prototype must be complete and included in the Research Ops submission before the study can begin.

---

### Location

Video interviews over Zoom (60 minutes for non-AT participants, 90 minutes for AT participants)

---

## Research materials 📔

**For moderated usability tests:**
- [Link to conversation guide](conversation-guide.md)
- [Link to coded prototype (GitHub Codespace)](url goes here) - *In progress, URL TBD*

**Prototype will show:**
- Medical Records landing page with "Recent Results" cards (Labs, Care Notes)
- Cards show counts and time frame ("2 new results - last 7 days")
- Click-through to list pages with "RECENT" badges next to recent items
- Click-through to list pages with "RECENT" Indicators next to recent items

> **Note:** The coded prototype is currently being built by the lead UX designer.

## Recruitment 🎯

### Recruitment approach

**Target audience:** Veterans who actively use VA online medical records, including Veterans who use assistive technology (AT).

**Strategy:** We are aiming for a **50/50 split between AT and non-AT participants**. Lean maximum variation sampling to ensure diversity in:
- AT vs. non-AT use
- Medical complexity (simple vs. complex histories)
- Tech comfort (low, medium, high)
- Frequency of use (occasional vs. regular)
- Age range (including 55+)

**AT types to test:** Screen readers and screen magnification (desktop/laptop)

**Recruiting partner:** Perigean

> **Note on recruitment survey:** There is a limit to how many questions Perigean can include in the Calendly screener survey. Consider a tiered approach (Tier 1 questions for all participants; Tier 2 AT-specific questions for those who indicate AT use). Provide a copy or link to the recruitment survey to Perigean before the kickoff call so both parties can review it together.

> **AT participant vetting:** If there are any questions about whether a recruited AT participant meets the qualification criteria, contact the ADE team via their Slack channel. ADE can vet AT participants for appropriateness.
