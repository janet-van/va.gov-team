# PCMM convergence scoring for care team selection

This doc describes how we can help users pick a relevant care team by comparing patient's assigned care team providers and the pools that these providers belong to.

## Solution description
- Rank OH message pools by relevance to each patient, so the most relevant pools surface to the top of the list instead of being buried in 50-100+ alphabetical entries.

### Here's an analogy: 
You walk into a massive food court with 80 restaurants. You have no idea which one is "yours." You just see a giant alphabetical list: Arby's, Burger King, Chili's... Zaxby's. Good luck.

But we know something about you: your family's favorite chefs. Your mom cooks at Green Kitchen, your dad cooks at Green Kitchen, your sister cooks at Green Kitchen, and your uncle cooks at the Pharmacy Cafe. Convergence scoring = we walk through every restaurant and count how many of your family's chefs work there.

- Green Kitchen: 3 of your 4 chefs work here → score 0.75 → "this is probably your family restaurant"
- Pharmacy Cafe: 1 of your 4 → score 0.25 → "maybe relevant"
- Red Kitchen: 0 of your 4 → score 0.00 → "probably not yours"
  
Instead of alphabetical, we put Green Kitchen at the top. You still see all 80 restaurants, but we just made an educated guess about which one is yours based on who cooks there.

**Why we can't just read the sign on the door**: The restaurants and the chef directory are managed by two completely different companies. The sign might say "Green Kitchen" but the chef directory calls your family's team "PACT Team Bravo." No shared naming. So we match on the chefs, not the signs.

## How it works
1. At session start, SM Patient API calls the PCMM API to get the patient's assigned care team providers (IENs)
2. Cross-reference IENs against `OHS.OH\_POOL\_PRACTITIONER`. This is an ETL table in the SM Oracle RDS that maps providers to OH message pools (loaded daily from CDW, ~22,800 rows / 2,092 pools)
3. For each pool, we calculate: `convergence\_score = (# of patient's PCMM providers in this pool) / (total PCMM providers for patient)`
4. Rank pools: score DESC → pool type (Clinical > Other) → pool size ASC → alphabetical
5. Score + rank returned alongside existing triage group data via `TriageTeamDTO.convergenceScore` and `TriageTeamDTO.convergenceRank`

## Data sources
| Source | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| PCMM API | Patient's care team providers (IENs) | REST API called at session start |
| `OHS.OH_POOL_PRACTITIONER` | Provider → pool mapping | SM Oracle RDS (ETL from CDW daily) |
| `SMS.TRIAGE_GROUP` | Existing pool/TG data | SM Oracle RDS |

## UX options
1. **Sort within HCS sections**: In each HCS section, sort high-scoring pools to the top
2. **"Recommended for you" section**: Separate bucket at top of each HCS section with top-scoring pools, then full alphabetical list below. Clearer signal but introduces new UI concept.


## Limitations
- ~86-90% of patients have PCMM data. 10-14% won't get any scoring (fallback to alphabetical, current UX)
- Matching is by provider overlap, not a direct PCMM→pool link. Estimated 80-90% accuracy. Provider may be in a training pool or secondary pool that inflates its score
- PCMM data refreshes at session start. So changes during a session won't reflect until next login
- Cross-schema access needed (`OHS` schema from SM Patient API's `SMS` schema user). May need DB synonym or grant

## Future (100% confidence path)
Missing piece is a direct, authoritative link between PCMM team IDs and OH pool IDs. 

Some options:
1. **OH product change**: Oracle Health adds a PCMM team ID field to pool configuration.
2. **PCMM product change**: PCMM adds an OH pool ID field. 
3. **VA-managed crosswalk table**: We maintain a PCMM_TEAM_ID → OH_POOL_ID mapping ourselves. 100% accurate when maintained, but requires a curation process for ~2,000+ pools across all OH sites.

Convergence scoring is "good enough now". Any of the 100% paths could layer on top later as a scoring boost.
