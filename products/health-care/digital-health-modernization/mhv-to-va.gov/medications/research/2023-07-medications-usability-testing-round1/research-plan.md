# **Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medications, July 2023**

## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We have built a prototype of the Medications in MHV on VA.gov that we will be testing as part of this research study.

You can read more about our Digital Health Modernization strategy [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product).

## **OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online.
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

## **Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## **Research Goals**

1. Understand if Veterans can locate and fill/refill their medications.
2. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience with understanding the status of their medications.
3. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience with managing their medications.

## **Outcome**

The results of this study will help us determine if our designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to manage and view their medications to identify any pain points. This will inform later iterations of the design.

## **Research questions**

1. Are Veterans able to find the information they need to fill/refill their prescriptions?
   - Can Veterans find and identify the correct prescription they need?
   - Do Veterans understand how to complete the steps to submit a refill?
   - Do Veterans know that their refill request submission was successful?
2. Are Veterans able to understand the statuses of their prescriptions?
   - Do Veterans understand the status of a submitted order?
   - Do Veterans understand how to find information on what to do when a prescription is not refillable?
   - Do veterans understand when a prescription has not yet been filled?
   - How do Veterans interpret "expired"?
3. Are Veterans able to find the information they need to manage and understand their prescriptions?
   - Can Veterans find the physical description and image of their prescriptions?
   - Can Veterans find the reason for use for their prescriptions?
   - Do Veterans understand how to print their medication list?
   - Can Veterans find the instructions for their prescriptions?
   - Can Veterans find how many refills are left?

## **Hypothesis**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will be able to find the information they need to fill/refill their prescriptions.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will understand the statuses of their medications.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will be able to find the information they need to manage and understand their medications.

_Hypothesis 4:_ Some Veterans will confuse 'fill prescription' with 'refill prescription.'

_Hypothesis 4:_ Some Veterans will be confused by the connotation of "expired prescription."

## **Methodology**

We will conduct moderated usability testing interviews in which we will ask users to navigate the prototype, observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

## **Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
