# Background Context
background:
  problem_statement: "Veterans and their family members applying for CHAMPVA benefits currently lack digital infrastructure to view their application status, relying heavily on paper mail and manual processes. This results in delays, confusion, and repeated manual inquiries."
  product_location: "Authenticated experience, integrated into the existing Claim and Appeal Status Tool (CST)"
  user_familiarity: "Iteration on existing product - integrating CHAMPVA applications into the existing Claims Status Tool"
  product_brief_url: "https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/1010D/status-tool/chamva-status-tool-product-outline.md"

# Research Design
methodology: "usability testing"
research_format: 
  location: remote
  moderated: true
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Identify any usability issues in the CHAMPVA Application Status user flows, which include finding application status and identifying and uploading missing documents (requested information)"
  - goal_2: "Identify where participants expect their CHAMPVA Application status to live within the VA ecosystem, inclusive of MyVA and the status tool"
  - goal_3: "Identify any content comprehension challenges that might prevent participants from understanding their CHAMPVA Application Status and requested next steps, and how issues might differ between Veterans and non-Veterans"

research_questions:
  - "In what section of MyVA do participants expect to find their CHAMPVA application? Are they able to navigate to the status tool without assistance?"
  - "How do participants interpret the inclusion of CHAMPVA applications within the status tool? What do they expect to be included in the status tool based on the front page?"
  - "How do participants understand the application status for each of their beneficiaries based on the information presented in the status tool? Are there differences between how Veteran and beneficiary participants understand their status?"
  - "How do participants interpret the steps presented in the status tool? What mental model do participants have of how CHAMPVA applications are processed before using the status tool? What is their mental model after?"
  - "When participants receive an information request, are they able to easily understand how to upload the requested documents and why they're being asked for those documents?"
  - "When one beneficiary on an application is deemed eligible, and the other has a pending information request, how do participants understand what next steps to take? Does it make sense that the application stays open until both beneficiaries have been processed?"
  - "What are opportunities to improve the experience of participants using the status tool for their CHAMPVA application?"

hypotheses:
  - "Participants will be able to navigate through the prototype relatively easily and will react positively to seeing the status of their applications online"
  - "Participants may have issues identifying what section of MyVA to find CHAMPVA Applications in, since they are the only healthcare application listed alongside claims and appeals"
  - "Participants may have issues interpreting the steps a CHAMPVA application will go through to be processed"
  - "Participants may have issues interpreting the next steps on a CHAMPVA application when one beneficiary has been approved, and the other is missing documentation"
  - "Veteran participants will on average have more familiarity with VA.gov and benefits terminology. They might expect to track CHAMPVA application status within the existing Claims Status Tool"
  - "Spouse and dependent participants might already have their own VA.gov accounts or log into Veterans accounts to help them manage their benefits. They might be confused by Veteran-facing language on the homepage of the status tool"

expected_outcomes: "This research will help us identify usability and content issues with the CHAMPVA Application Status prototype. We will use these insights to refine the design and content of these screens before they are built. We will also be testing a new h1 for the Claims Status Tool, as well as new headings for the Claims and appeals and Forms and applications sections of MyVA. In addition, this study is part of the Design and Forms Systems Team's exploration of AI prototyping tools."

# Research Plan for VFMP Status Integration, Health Apps in Claims Status Tool, CHAMPVA Application Status MVP 02/2026

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Veterans and their family members applying for CHAMPVA benefits currently lack digital infrastructure to view their application status, relying heavily on paper mail and manual processes. This results in delays, backlogs, and a high volume of status  inquiries. Approximately 80% of calls to the CHAMPVA helpdesk are status inquiries, leading to significant wait times up to 2 hours.** 

**We will integrate CHAMPVA applications into the existing Claim and Appeal Status Tool (CST) to enhance transparency, reduce delays, and improve the overall user experience for veterans and their families. This solution aims to provide real-time access to application statuses, streamline documentation workflows by enabling applicants to upload missing documents online, and reduce call center volume.** 
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**Authenticated experience**
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**We are integrating CHAMPVA applications into the existing Claim and Appeal Status Tool (CST).**

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Identify any usability issues in the CHAMPVA Application Status user flows, which include finding application status and identifying and uploading missing documents (requested information).**

`2.` **Identify where participants expect their CHAMPVA Application status to live within the VA ecosystem, inclusive of MyVA and the status tool.**

`3.` **Identify any content comprehension challenges that might prevent participants from understanding their CHAMPVA Application Status and requested next steps, and how issues might differ between Veterans and beneficiaries.**
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**This research will help us identify usability and content issues with the CHAMPVA Application Status prototype. We will use these insights to refine the design and content of these screens before they go into production as an extension of the Claims Status Tool. Ultimately, this will enable Veterans and beneficiaries to clearly understand their CHAMPVA Application status, know when and how to upload missing documents, and reduce long call center wait times.** 

**We will also be testing a new h1 for the Claims Status Tool, as well as new headings for the "Claims and appeals" and "Forms and applications" sections of MyVA - since they will have to change once CHAMPVA applications are integrated into the Claims Status Tool. We developed these headings in collaboration with the CST and MyVA teams, and will report back to them with our findings. Participant feedback on these new headings will inform future research.**

**In addition, this study is part of the Design and Forms Systems Team's exploration of AI prototyping tools. See [github ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/5813). The prototypes for this study were built using Figma Make.**

---

### Research questions

**`1.` In what section of MyVA do participants expect to find their CHAMPVA application? Are they able to navigate to the status tool without assistance?** 

**`2.` How do participants interpret the inclusion of CHAMPVA applications within the status tool? What do they expect to be included in the status tool based on the front page?**

**`3.` How do participants understand the application status for each of their beneficiaries based on the information presented in the status tool? Are there differences between how Veteran and beneficiary participants understand the application status?**

**`4.` How do participants interpret the steps presented in the status tool? What mental model do participants have of how CHAMPVA applications are processed before using the status tool? What is their mental model after reading the steps?**

**`5.` When participants receive an information request, are they able to easily understand how to upload the requested documents and why they're being asked for those documents?**

**`6.` When one beneficiary on an application is deemed eligible, and the other has a pending information request, how do participants understand what next steps to take? Does it make sense that the application status still says Step 2, even though one of the applicants has already received an eligibility determination?**

**`7.` What are opportunities to improve the experience of participants using the status tool for their CHAMPVA application?**

### Hypotheses
 
**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

---

Our hypothesis is that participants will be able to navigate through the prototype relatively easily. Based on prior research, we expect that they will react positively to seeing the status of their application and being able to upload requested documents online. 

Participants may also have issues with the following, since they are unique to CHAMPVA applications: 

- Identifying what section of MyVA to find CHAMPVA Applications in, since they are the only healthcare application listed alongside claims and appeals
- Interpreting the steps a CHAMPVA application will go through to be processed
- Interpreting the next steps on a CHAMPVA application when one beneficiary has been approved, and the other is missing documentation

Based on prior research with these user groups, we also expect that: 
- **Veteran participants** will on average have more familiarity with VA.gov and benefits terminology. They might expect to track CHAMPVA application status within the existing Claims Status Tool.
- **Spouse and dependent participants** might already have their own VA.gov accounts or log into Veterans accounts to help them manage their benefits. So, it’s likely that some spouse or dependent participants may be familiar with VA.gov and benefits terminology.
	- They might be confused by Veteran-facing language on the homepage of the status tool like “Your claim letters” and “Your travel claims”. However, the CHAMPVA application status pages are designed to be read by either a Veteran or their spouse/dependents, and they should be able to understand who the application status and any information requests apply to 
  
---
   
## Methodology  🛠️
This will be a usability study conducted remotely via Zoom.  
 
The moderator will ask the participant some introductory questions about their previous experience applying for benefits and using VA.gov, as well as their awareness of the CHAMPVA program. Then, participants will be asked to complete the following tasks on a Figma prototype: 
- The user has recently applied for CHAMPVA benefits and wants to check the status of their application.
- The user logs in again and has to upload the requested missing information for their CHAMPVA application.
- The user logs in again once their CHAMPVA application has been closed and wants to understand the eligibility of each person on the application.   
 
Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of each flow.

## Recruitment 🎯	

### Recruitment approach

We would like Perigean to recruit Veterans with high disability ratings and their dependent spouses and children. We will split this study into two cohorts: 

We will split this study into two cohorts:
- **Cohort 1 (8 completed)**: Veterans with a 100% service-connected disability rating with spouse and/or dependent children.
- **Cohort 2 (8 completed)**: Spouses and dependent children of Veterans with a 100% service connected disabilty rating.

Only 3 participants per cohort should be currently enrolled in the CHAMPVA program. Prior knowledge or previous tool exposure will affect their understanding of the new content in the prototype, but might also provide useful insights. 

### Recruitment criteria
