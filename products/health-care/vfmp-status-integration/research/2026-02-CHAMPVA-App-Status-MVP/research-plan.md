# Research Plan for VFMP Status Integration, Health Apps in Claims Status Tool, CHAMPVA Application Status MVP 02/2026

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Veterans and their families enrolled in CHAMPVA currently lack digital infrastructure to manage their application status, relying heavily on paper mail and manual processes. This results in delays, backlogs, and a high volume of status inquiries. Approximately 80% of calls to the CHAMPVA helpdesk are status inquiries, leading to significant wait times.** 

**We will integrate CHAMPVA applications into the existing Claim and Appeal Status Tool (CST) to enhance transparency, reduce delays, and improve the overall user experience for veterans and their families. This solution aims to provide real-time access to application statuses, streamline documentation workflows, and reduce call center volume.**
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**Authenticated experience**
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**We are integrating CHAMPVA applications into the existing Claim and Appeal Status Tool (CST).**

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Identify any usability issues or confusing language in the CHAMPVA Application Status prototype.**

`2.` **Identify any confusion or assumptions caused by including CHAMPVA Applications alongside Claims and Appeals in the status tool**

`3.` **Determine whether or not Veterans and beneficiaries are able to understand the status of their application and upload requested documents using the CHAMPVA Application Status prototype**
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**This research will help us identify usability and content issues with the CHAMPVA Application Status prototype. We will use these insights to refine the design and content of these screens before they go into production as an extension of the Claims Status Tool. Ultimately, this will enable Veterans and beneficiaries to clearly understand their CHAMPVA Application status, know when and how to upload missing documents, and reduce long call center wait times.** 

---

### Research questions

**`1.` In what section of MyVA do participants expect to find their CHAMPVA application? Are they able to navigate to the status tool without assistance?** 

**`2.` How do participants interpret the inclusion of CHAMPVA applications within the status tool? What do they expect to be included in the status tool based on the front page?**

**`3.` How do Veterans understand the application status for each of their beneficiaries based on the information presented in the status tool?**

**`4.` How do beneficiaries understand the status of their application based on the information presented in the status tool?**

**`5.` How do participants interpret the steps presented in the status tool? How do they interpret the steps in order to build a mental model of how CHAMPVA applications are processed?**

**`6.` When participants receive an evidence request, are they able to easily understand how to upload the requested documents and why they're being asked for those documents?**

**`7.` When one beneficiary on an application is deemed eligible, and the other has a pending evidence request – how do participants understand what next steps to take? Does the status of the application make sense to them?**

**`8.` What are opportunities to help participants understand the status of their CHAMPVA application?**


### Hypotheses
 
**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

---

Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through the prototype relatively easily. We assume that they will react positively to seeing the status of their application and being able to upload requested documents online. 

However, they may have issues with the following: 

- Navigating to the status tool from MyVA, understanding what section to find CHAMPVA Applications in
- Understanding that CHAMPVA applications are the only applications included in the status tool
- Interpreting the steps a CHAMPVA application will go through to be processed, and understanding the current status of their application
- Understanding how to upload requested documents
- Interpreting the next steps on a CHAMPVA application when one beneficiary has been approved, and the other is missing documentation

## Methodology  🛠️
This will be a usability study conducted remotely via Zoom.  
 
The moderator will ask the participant some introductory questions about their previous experience applying for benefits and using VA.gov. Then, participants will be asked to complete the following tasks on a Figma prototype: 
- The user has recently applied for CHAMPVA benefits and wants to check the status of their application.
- The user received a letter in the mail requesting them to submit additional information. They follow the link in the letter in order to submit the requested documents.  
 
Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of each flow.  

### Location
Remote research, over Zoom.

- [x] **Remote**
- [ ] **In-person**

## Recruitment 🎯	

### Recruitment approach

We would like Perigean to recruit Veterans and family members (spouses and dependents)

Our intended audience for this study is Veterans with high disability ratings and their dependent spouses and children, who are **not currently enrolled** in the CHAMPVA program. We don't want prior knowledge or previous tool exposure to affect their understanding of the new content in the prototype.

We will split this study into two cohorts:
- **Cohort 1 (5 completed)**: Veterans with a 100% service connected disability rating with spouse and/or dependent children, who are not currently enrolled in CHAMPVA benefits.
- **Cohort 2 (5 completed)**: Spouses and dependent children of Veterans with a 100% service connected disabilty rating, who are not currently enrolled in CHAMPVA benefits.
