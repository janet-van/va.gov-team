# Research Plan for CDS Platform Team, CDS Console Sidebar Navigation, Q2 2025
> [!NOTE]
> *Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out first in the via Slack in [#cds-hcd-cop] (https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C06043YBWTC) or if more help is needed check out the [#research-ops](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C0216PL32HJ) Slack channel.* 

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Evaluate whether updates to the sidebar navigation concept improve efficiency and usability by refining the information architecture and ensuring a clear, intuitive structure</summary>
	
`What problem is your product or feature trying to solve?`

**The current header navigation in the CDS Console occupies too much vertical space, hindering the viewability of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) application content. Clinicians face significant challenges navigating between different CDS content and data across applications, resulting in a "fragmented" experience that is disconnected from the workflow-based approach they need to deliver clinical care effectively and enhance opportunities for care coordination.**
  
`Where is your product situated within the clinicians' or VA staff's toolset (ex: CDS Console > MedCalc)`

**The CDS Console serves as the central hub for clinical decision support tools. It includes applications such as MWW (My Workflow Workspace), MedCalc (Medical Calculators), Voogle, STORM, and Task Manager. The sidebar navigation is the primary means of access between these tools.**
  
`What is clinicians' familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**This is an iteration on an existing product. The CDS Console is familiar to participating clinicians. Round 1 usability testing validated the sidebar navigation concept over the existing header navigation. Round 2 testing builds on those findings to refine the design ahead of V1/MVP implementation scheduled to begin in Q2 2025.**

</details>

## Research Goals 🎯

**Goal 1:** Evaluate whether updates to the sidebar navigation improve efficiency and usability by refining the information architecture and ensuring a clear, intuitive structure.

**Goal 2:** Identify any remaining usability challenges clinicians face when interacting with the navigation, focusing on wayfinding, discoverability, and workflow alignment.

**Goal 3:** Assess the effectiveness of the visual hierarchy and organization within the sidebar to ensure key tools and CDS applications are easily accessible and logically grouped.

### Outcome
Findings from this research will inform final design refinements before V1/MVP implementation. Any usability challenges identified will be addressed to ensure an optimized experience. Opportunities for enhancements will be captured for consideration in future releases based on product prioritization.

## Research Questions ❓

- Does the revised sidebar navigation improve clinicians' ability to locate and access necessary tools quickly?
- Are there any lingering usability issues causing friction in workflow efficiency?
- Do users understand the labeling and grouping of navigation elements?
- How are patient demographic details best displayed consistently across focus areas and user journey milestones?
- How do navigation interactions align with clinician workflow needs across different tools (MWW, MedCalc, Task Manager)?

## Hypotheses 💡

**Hypothesis 1 (Primary):** We believe that addressing usability issues identified in Round 1 testing will improve the effectiveness of the V1/MVP sidebar navigation implementation, making it easier for clinicians to navigate between CDS applications and tools. By optimizing the organization of navigational elements, refining interactions, and streamlining transitions, we expect clinicians to experience fewer workflow interruptions and locate essential tools more efficiently.

**Hypothesis 2 (Secondary):** We believe that standardizing the display of patient demographic details across the user journey will enhance usability and ensure alignment with patient safety standards. By improving consistency and gathering user expectations, we expect to reduce cognitive load, minimize errors, and improve clinician confidence in accessing critical patient information.

## Method 🔬

**Moderated usability testing** using two clickable Figma prototypes (Prototype A and Prototype B) conducted remotely via MS Teams.

### User Flows / Scenarios Tested

- **Flow 1:** User starts in MWW, navigates to the CDS Console, then to MedCalc.
- **Flow 2:** User starts in MedCalc, gathers a calculation, then creates a task.
- **Flow 3:** User launches Voogle; User launches STORM.
- **Flow 4:** Patient context change.

**Focus Topics:**
- Patient demographic details display
- Interactions across scenarios
- Navigational orientation and clarity
- Navigation labels

### Notetaker and Silent Observer Guide
- Be a silent observer. If you have a question for the participant, ask the facilitator via a Slack DM and they'll accommodate it if appropriate.
- If you can notetake, please do! Use the note taking template in the [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/thoughtworksclientprojects1205/m/thoughtworksclientprojects1205/1740762221224/572e7d830b11d84b545341f0546714bd48a489b3) with screenshots.
- Write what you hear and see as much as possible. Try to capture what participants said without adding your own interpretation.
- Share your notes back with the facilitator via Slack if taken outside of the Mural. Do not include ANY PII in this chat.
- For design testing, write down things that aren't said — when someone misunderstood copy or clicked the wrong element.

**Protecting PII**
- Do not include the participant's name or other identifiers in your notes. Use a general role description such as "primary care provider."
- In the event a participant needs to share their screen with a real patient visible, stop the recording before they share. **DO NOT RECORD THE PARTICIPANT'S SCREEN IF THEY ARE SHOWING A REAL PATIENT.**
