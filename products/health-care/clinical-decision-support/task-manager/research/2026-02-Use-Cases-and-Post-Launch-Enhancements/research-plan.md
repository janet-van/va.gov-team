## Background 🏗️

<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>

`What problem is your product or feature trying to solve?`

Task Manager is a team-based task management application, providing teams with a centralized, customizable, secure repository to support patient clinical workflows by facilitating task and activity tracking, collaboration and coordination.

This provides visibility on workflow tasks and activities, ensuring that patient and clinical tasks and activities are acted upon and followed through with. 

`Where is your product situated within the clinicians' or VA staff's toolset (ex: CDS Console > MedCalc)`

**CDS Console \ Task Manager**

`What is clinicians' familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**Task manager is a relatively new addition to the CDS suite of applications, taking the place of CMT which is reaching end of life, soon to be decommissioned.**

## Research Goals 🥅	

`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

> [!NOTE]
> Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

### Goals

As Task Manager moves beyond baseline parity CMT functionality. The team seeks to better understand what features and functions will be most useful for current and prospective task manager users.

The research aims to:

`1.` Gather insight into the types of workflows, use cases and scenarios clinicians are hoping to manage through Task Manager.

`2.` Gather insights into the user task management workflows from task creation, to assignment, to task completion.

`3.` Gather feedback from current task manager users regarding pain points, bright spots and desires relating to task creation, monitoring and follow-through. 

### Outcome

`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

Insights about use cases and workflows, and feedback about product pain points and bright spots will help uncover feature gaps, and future ideas for enhancements.

---

### Research questions

> [!NOTE]
> Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the` [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/clinical-decision-support/research-templates/conversation-guide.md)

<details><summary>Guidance about forming research questions</summary>

***Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:***
	
`What will I do with what I learn from this question?`

`Does this question serve the goals of my study?`

</details>

### Use cases and Workflows 

`1.` When it comes to your role at VA, what types of work involve managing tasks? These can be tasks you're managing individually, or tasks you're coordinating with team members 

`2.` For the workflows you're looking to manage: What type of tasks are involved?  Who's typically involved with this work? How are they involved in this work?

### Task Manager Product Feedback 

`1.` Can you share a little bit about your overall experience with creating tasks?
What’s working? What can be improved? 

`2.` Can you share a little bit about your overall experience with tracking and monitoring tasks?What’s working? What can be improved?*

`3.` Can you share a little bit about your overall experience with task follow-up, record updates and follow-through? What's working? What can be improved?

`4.` With regard to the task list, what columns do you find to be relevant and useful? What might be missing?

`5.` With regard to the task details, what fields do you find to be relevant and useful? What fields are missing?

### Hypotheses

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to constrain the hypotheses to the goals of your study!

<details><summary>Guidance about developing research hypothesis</summary>

**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`

`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)`

`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

</details>

---

**Task assignment:**

- The current object model (relationship between tasks, teams and members) may not meet the needs of all teams using task manager.
- Some PACT teams may want to share tasks across departments.
- Some teams may want to support a more "pull-based" workflow, in which tasks as pulled from a common pool of unassigned tasks.

**Task Management**

- User workflows may require additional ways to categorize and organize tasks, including potentially more detailed statuses or ways to label tasks. 

**Workflow Efficiency**

- Currently all task details are entered in manually. Users may wish for ways to accelerate their task creation flow with bulk task creation, templatization.

---

## Methodology  🛠️

*Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.* 

<details><summary>Examples of common research methods include</summary> 


- `Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research`
- `Contextual inquiry - appropriate for generative research`
- `Card sorts - appropriate for generative and evaluative research; depending on the study design` 
- `Tree tests - appropriate for evaluative research`
- `Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research`
- `User acceptance testing (UAT) - required before product release`

</details>

This study will consist of:

- **Semi-structured discussion** – To gather use case and workflow insight.

- **Contextual inquiry** – to gather insight about current product pain points and opportunities.

### Location

Currently, all clinical research for CDSC takes place remotely over MS Teams. We do not have processes in place to conduct in-person research with clinicians and VA staff. We will update this guide as things change.

## Recruitment 🎯	

*Recruitment for CDSC research is done by the researcher. Account for recruitment in your planning and preparation time. Ideally outreach begins 2-4 weeks ahead of targeted testing dates*


### Recruitment approach

*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. clinicians, VHA administrative staff, coordinators, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 

<details><summary>Examples of recruitment sources</summary>

**`1.`CDSC Research Participant Database:** The CDSC research participant database is available to CDSC HCD Practitioners. If you are not part of this group, ask the OCTO CDSC VA Lead to assist with recruitment. 

**`2.`SSS Clinician Office Hours:** SSS hosts a weekly office hours for clinicians and other VHA staff. If you have an upcoming study, consider attending office hours to share about your study and see if any folks are interested or could connect you with someone.

**`3.`Application Support and Feedback:** SSS manages initial platform and app team support for CDS. Review support and feedback queries that come in and see who submitted the feedback and if they might match your study criteria. For example, a physician who requested a new calculator or had trouble with auto population may be interested in reviewing new designs.

**`4.`Snowball:** Ask your prior participants if they can share your name and email or the sign-up form with their colleagues to find new participants.

**`5.`Product SME:** Ask your product SME if they have other contacts you can engage with. 

</details>

`Audience:` Current TM Users

**Primary Participant Sources:**

- Task Manager CoP teams group
- User who have previously provided the team feedback through the feedback spreadsheet

**Secondary Participant Sources**

- CDSC Research Participant Database
- Snowball Recruit
- Product SME Referral 

### Recruitment criteria

**Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. This is helpful if getting recruitment assistance from CDSC peers.**

<details><summary>Research recruitment considerations</summary>

- Provide links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question. 
  Example: Have you used CDS Medical Calculators in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider what criteria MUST be met, versus what is nice to have.

</details>

Currently using task manager, or exploring task manager as a tool managing task tracking and coordination 

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (clinicians, VHA administrative staff, coordinators, etc.) of participants for this study:

> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **2x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 6 ideal completed sessions, plan to email at least 12 participants)*

| Function                  | Count |
| ------------------------- | ----- |
| Nursing                   | 10    |
| Admin/Ops                 | 6     |
| Behavioral Health         | 4     |
| Pharmacy                  | 3     |
| Physician                 | 1     |
| Target Completed Sessions | 24    |

### Primary criteria (must-haves)

*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study. For example, is it important to capture both inpatient and outpatient care settings? Or are you looking for a certain specialty or role such as a nurse practitionaer or physician?* 

- `Current user of Task Manager, or exploring adopting task manager`
- `Diversity across functional role (Nursing, Admin/Ops, Behavioral hleaht, Pharmacy, Physician)`

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)

*What criteria would strengthen your results? For example, getting a variety of FTE percentage (patient facing time) or providers who work float schedules. Secondary criteria could also be role types, specialty, etc depending on the priority for a given study* 

- `Diversity across VA locations`

## Timeline 🗓️

Consider recruitment lead time is often 2-4 weeks. 

### Outreach Email Templates

**General template, adjustments made for individual emails based on context or prior connection with participant. The outreach email must contain the line about voluntary participation and anonymity**

Hello. My name is Ruben. I'm one of the team members working on the [Clinical Decision Support Task Manager App](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/CDSProgramTeam/SitePages/Task%20Manager/Task-Manager-Learn-More.aspx). We're reaching out, since you've previously participated in our Community of Practice on Microsoft Teams, or have provided feedback through the online form in our app.

Following the release of our application, our team is conducting a listening tour to better understand how your team is tracking and coordinating tasks. We also interested in hearing about any pain points you've encountered while using our app.

If you're open to it, I'd love to connect with you to hear about how task management shows up in your work at VA health systems. To facilitate coordination, I've put together a booking page with 1 hour time slots. Feel free to book a slot convenient for you.

***[Book time to share feedback about task management](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/cbc53bd5af26426eab7c03f340da27e8@va.gov?anonymous&ismsaljsauthenabled&ep=plink)***

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to reach out directly. If you're not interested in participating in these types of sessions, that’s fine as well. Let me know, and we'll be sure not to reach out to you to gather this type of feedback.

Best regards,

Ruben Sun

### Notetaker and Silent Observer Guide

- Be a silent observer. If you have a question for the participant, ask the facilitator via a Slack DM and they'll accommodate it if appropriate.
- If you can notetake, please do! It helps researchers a lot to see what you captured. There’s a note taking template in this Mural with screenshots. If you find it easier to write your notes or use a word doc, that's fine too! If you take running notes, please be sure to make a clear reference to the screen in question or the scenario being mentioned.
- Write what you hear and see as much as possible. For some it can be easier to write in first person, as it is said, so that you don't need to paraphrase anything. Try to capture what they said without adding your own interpretation of what they meant. E.g. "I'm not sure about this checkbox" does not equal "Doesn't understand checkbox."
- Share your notes back with the facilitator via Slack if taken outside of the mural. Do not include ANY PII in this chat.
- For design testing, try to write down things that aren't said—for instance, when someone misunderstood some copy or clicked the wrong element. It helps us figure out what needs to be revisited.
- Share a few raw impressions with the facilitator via Slack or in the notetaking document after the interview is done, if possible. It helps with synthesis!

**Protecting PII**

- It's important to protect the privacy of our VHA staff participants AND any Veterans. 
- Do not include the participants name or other identifiers -- such as a very specific title that can be easy to identify them with in your notes. Instead, use a general role description, such as "primary care provider" and "also works in informatics"
- In the event a participant needs to share their screen or a tool with an actual patient (since test patients don't always work to show how the tool functions), stop the recording before they share. DO NOT RECORD THE PARTICIPANT'S SCREEN IF THEY ARE SHOWING A REAL PATIENT.
