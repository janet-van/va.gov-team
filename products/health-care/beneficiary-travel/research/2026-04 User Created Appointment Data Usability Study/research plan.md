product_area: "authenticated"

# Background Context
background:
  problem_statement: "Some medical appointments (community care and unscheduled VA appointments like walk-ins or emergency visits) do not appear in a Veteran's past appointment list. Veterans cannot file for travel pay on VA.gov for these appointments and must use the legacy BTSSS system to manually enter appointment information. This creates a fragmented user experience and prevents VA.gov from being a complete travel reimbursement solution."
  product_location: "Authenticated VA.gov experience - Health care benefits section, specifically within the Travel Pay claim filing flow"
  user_familiarity: "Iteration on existing product. Veterans are already familiar with filing travel pay claims on VA.gov (complex claims launched February 2026), but this adds new functionality to manually create missing appointments."
  product_brief_url: "https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/beneficiary-travel/product"

# Research Design
methodology: "Moderated usability testing with comparative analysis"
research_format: 
  location: remote
  moderated: true
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Determine the optimal entry point for user-generated appointment data functionality"
  - goal_2: "Validate that Veterans can successfully enter appointment data and claim information to file travel claims"
  - goal_3: "Evaluate how Veterans perceive user-generated appointment data in relation to system generated appointments"

research_questions:
  - "Where do Veterans expect to start when filing a travel claim for an appointment that doesn't appear in their list?"
  - "How do Veterans perceive and distinguish user-generated appointments from system-generated appointments?"
  - "How do Veterans remember or keep track of the information they need to enter for missing appointments?"
  - "Do Veterans understand that once they enter appointment data, they cannot edit it?"
  - "Do Veterans expect VA to tell them if they enter data about an appointment that already exists?"
  - "Can Veterans successfully create an appointment and file a travel claim using user-entered data?"
  - "Do Veterans expect their appointment to be displayed in their list of appointments?"

hypotheses:
  - "Veterans will not have a strong preference for where they begin filing a travel claim for a missing appointment, as they may view both past appointments and claims as valid entry points. However, the past appointments page may feel slightly more intuitive given the existing pattern of filing from past appointments on VA.gov."
  - "Veterans will be able to successfully enter the required appointment information and create a claim, but may be confused by the user-generated appointment not appearing in the past appointments list."
  - "Veterans will expect VA to prevent them from creating duplicates, which could indicate a moderate risk of increased appointment and claim duplication."

expected_outcomes: "This research will directly inform design and development decisions for releasing user-generated appointment functionality on VA.gov. Findings will determine where to place the entry point for user-generated appointment data, identify issues in the appointment data creation flow, refine designs based on user feedback, and validate related community care work."

# Research Plan for Travel Pay User Created Appointment Data Usability Study - March/April 2026

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

Some medical appointments, such as community care and other unscheduled VA appointments like walk-ins, do not appear in a Veteran’s past appointment list. This means that Veterans cannot file for travel pay on VA.gov and are instead required to go to the legacy Beneficiary Travel Self-Service System (BTSSS) to enter their appointment info in order to input a user-created appointment as a starting point for their travel claim. 

We need to enable Veterans to file travel reimbursement claims on VA.gov for appointments that don’t appear in their appointments list, consolidating more travel pay functionality on VA.gov and reducing reliance on BTSSS. Our goal is to create a complete, self-contained travel reimbursement claim experience on VA.gov.
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

Authenticated
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

This is an iteration and enhancement of existing VA.gov travel pay functionality. In February 2026, the Travel Pay team launched complex claims on VA.gov, allowing Veterans to upload receipts for all travel claim expenses. However, additional travel reimbursement claim features still exist in the legacy BTSSS portal, including the ability to manually create appointments that don’t appear in the past appointments list. Veterans who currently file for travel pay on VA.gov are familiar with complex claims on VA.gov and also may be familiar with this process in the BTSSS portal.

**Key Takeaways from Previous Research:**
- `Reimbursement Status Takeaway: Navigation Patterns: 6 of 9 participants "satisfice" - taking the first available option from Top Pages rather than thinking deeply about navigation`
- `Status Language Takeaway: Participants struggled to connect individual claim statuses within the larger process - they wanted proactive notifications about critical phases.`
- `Concept Study Takeaway: Participants had clear preferences for continued communication and visibility about their claim post-submission.`

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO%20FY26%20goals%20supported.md) 

<details><summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support? </summary>

`Objective 1:  Optimize software delivery for Veteran impact.`  

> - **Key Result 1.3:** Supports the decommissioning of a legacy system by enabling Veterans to complete travel pay tasks on VA.gov that currently require BTSSS, advancing efforts to reduce reliance on and eventually decommission the legacy BTSSS system.
  - ***Research Ops Plain Language:** Veterans can do more travel pay tasks on VA.gov instead of having to use the old BTSSS system. This helps VA retire BTSSS.*

`Objective 3: Relentlessly improve the user experience.`

> - **Key Result 3.1:** Supports the Health portfolio in improving customer satisfaction by removing barriers to filing travel reimbursement claims and creating a more complete travel reimbursement claim experience on VA.gov.   
> - **Key Result 3.2:** Supports maintaining the ranked list of user pain points by investigating a documented pain point, i.e. Veterans' inability to file claims for appointments not appearing in their list on VA.gov.    
> - **Key Result 3.3:** Supports the delivery of at least one release that directly addresses this documented user pain point by enabling Veterans to create missing appointments and file associated travel claims entirely within VA.gov.   
  - ***Research Ops Plain Language:** Letting Veterans create missing appointments so they can file travel claims for them fixes a pain point and makes filing easier.*

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Determine the optimal entry point for user-generated appointment data functionality.**

`2.` **Validate that Veterans can successfully enter appointment data and claim information to file travel claims.**

`3.` **Evaluate how Veterans perceive user-generated appointment data in relation to system generated appointments.** 
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

This research will directly inform our design and development decisions for releasing user-generated appointment functionality on VA.gov. As travel pay continues to migrate from BTSSS to VA.gov, we must determine the best way to implement this capability to ensure Veterans have a complete, intuitive travel reimbursement experience.

We will use the findings to:
Determine where to place the entry point for user-generated appointment data
Identify issues in the appointment data creation flow and refine designs based on user feedback
Validate related community care work, which is a primary use case for this new functionality.

---

### Research questions

**`1.`Where do Veterans expect to start when filing a travel claim for an appointment that doesn't appear in their list?**     

**`2.`How do Veterans remember or keep track of the information they need to enter for missing appointments?**   

**`3.`Do Veterans understand that once they enter appointment data, they cannot edit it?**   

**`4.`Do Veterans expect VA to tell them if they enter data about an appointment that already exists?**   

**`5.`Can Veterans successfully create an appointment and file a travel claim using user-entered data?**   

**`6.`Do Veterans expect their appointment to be displayed in their list of appointments?**   


### Hypotheses
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 
* We will measure entry-point preference, by comparing the number of people who choose to create their appointment on the past appointment list to those who prefer to create their appointment from the travel claims list.
* We will measure task completion, by the number of people who are able to successfully complete the flow to create an appointment and then file the corresponding claim.
* We want to gather qualitatitive feedback about the flow to determine usability and navigability. 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
* Veterans are more familiar with creating claims from their past appointment list, as that is the current pattern.   
* Veterans will have preconceived ideas about how the process should function, depending on their familiarity with BTSSS, the VA Health and Benefits app (VAHB), and simple mileage only claims (SMOC).    
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product?`   
* We assume that Veterans will be able to successfully create claims from either entry point and will not have a definitive preference, although they may find creating claims from the past appointment list is more familiar. We also expect that when starting from the past appointments list, they will expect the appointment to be added to this list.
* We expect Veterans will successfully complete the form fields, but may question the purpose of certain fields (i.e. appointment name, type).
* We expect participants think they can access their claim with user-generated appointment information from the past appointments list.   
* We think that while Veterans may be slightly confused by their user generated appointments not appearing in the past appointments list, they will be able to easily identify the claims associated with those appointments in their claims list. However, we recognize there is a risk of duplicate claims due to the separate views.

---
**Hypothesis**   

We hypothesize that Veterans will not have a strong preference for where they begin filing a travel claim for a missing appointment, as they may view both past appointments and claims as valid entry points. However, we believe the past appointments page may feel slightly more intuitive given the existing pattern of filing from past appointments on VA.gov.   

We anticipate that Veterans will be able to successfully enter the required appointment information and then create a claim, but may be confused by the user-generated appointment not appearing in the past appointments list. We also predict that users will expect VA to prevent them from creating duplicates, which could indicate a moderate risk of increased appointment and claim duplication.   

---
  
## Methodology  🛠️   
<details>
We will conduct moderated usability testing sessions with 10-12 Veterans using a clickable Figma prototype. This study will be a hybrid study. The first part will evaluate participants’ mental models around where they expect to create an appointment, then we’ll move into a usability test of the user-created appointment data screens. Finally, we will show the participants the alternate entry-point option and ask questions for a comparative analysis.

### Structure      

**Warm-up (5 minutes)**
We will begin each session with introductory questions to understand participants’ familiarity with travel reimbursement, their experience filing claims on VA.gov, BTSSS, or in VAHB.

**Entry-point navigation (5-10 minutes)**
We will provide a brief scenario, then ask participants to navigate from VA.gov’s homepage using our prototype to find where they would file a claim for an appointment that doesn’t appear in their past appointments list. The entry point locations are past appointments and the travel claims list page.

**Primary usability testing (25-30 minutes)**
Once the participant has reached an entry point, we will observe them as they complete the full flow: creating an appointment using the required fields, adding proof of attendance, and a mileage expense, and then submitting the claim. 

**Alternate entry-point evaluation (5-8 minutes)**
After completing the flow from the self-selected entry point, we’ll guide participants to the alternative entry point. We’ll ask them to evaluate whether this path feels natural and whether it conflicts with their mental model of where travel claims functionality lives on the site.

**4a. Comparative entry point assessment (Optional, if time permits, 5-8 minutes)**
Time permitting, we will also show participants the static mock ups of both entry points side-by-side and ask what works well or doesn’t work well for each page. This will help us distinguish between preferences for navigation path versus preferences for the content, call to action placement, and messaging on each page itself.

**Wrap up (3 minutes)**
We’ll wrap up with some closing questions and allow the participants time to express any final thoughts.
