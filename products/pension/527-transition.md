# 527EZ Transition Hub

**Updated March 2026**

> The purpose of this transition document is to outline the current state of 527EZ forms' product development. It serves as a "front door" to documentation and resources collected during the course of product design and development from January 2024 through March 2025. Included are links to more specific transition hubs where you can find direct links to resources and references used during design and development. These Transition Docs are "point in time" documents, and may not reflect current progress, deployments or upcoming efforts.

## Product context 

- The online **527EZ** form allows Veterans to fill out and submit the application for Veterans Pension benefits. If the applicant is a wartime Veteran and  at least 65 years old, or if they have a permanent and total disability, they may be eligible. Their income and net worth need to be within certain limits.
  - [About VA Form 527EZ (Application for Veterans Pension)](https://www.va.gov/forms/21p-527ez/)
  - Re-launched on VA.gov: 1/31/2024
  - Annual submission volume: 10,665 (2025)
  - Current PDF version on VA.gov: DEC 2025

### Product Goal

Make the online pension experience as easy to complete and cohesive as possible, while ensuring that Veterans provide sufficient supporting documentation to ensure that submissions are reliable and processed as quickly as possible.

#### 21-527EZ Application for Veterans Pension

The online pension application is available in the [production environment](https://www.va.gov/pension/apply-for-veteran-pension-form-21p-527ez/introduction).  The staging environment version of the form is [here](https://staging.va.gov/pension/apply-for-veteran-pension-form-21p-527ez/introduction).

## Roadmap

### Done (recently)



- **[Minimal header update](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/125719)** - The Minimal header is the latest standard header for usage in forms. The goal is to help the user focus on the task at hand. Released 3/12/26.
-  **[New pages for supporting documents](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/130632)** - Added new conditional pages informing applicants when medical records, VA forms, or supporting documents are required based on their answers. Released 3/3/26.
  - **[Alerts for service-connected disability ratings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/121731)** - Updated Pension service-connected disability alerts to include "100% service-connected disability rating" to avoid confusion with applicants that have non-service connected disability conditions. Released on 2/1/26.
- **[BPDS for Pension](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/digital-experience-products/issues/1262)** - VA.gov now sends tructured JSON data directly to BPDS. POI then retrieves and uses this data for processing, eliminating the need to perform OCR on submitted PDF forms. Released January 2026.
-  **[LOA3 Authentication for Pension](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/16662)** - 527EZ now requires authentication for all users. Released December 2025.

## Design opportunities

This is a collection of notes on design work that we started and set aside for various reasons. It should help add context if picked up again.

### Improving the unreimbursed care and medical expenses step

#### Problem it solves  

Applicants often don’t understand what medical expenses to report and end up estimating and/or reporting expenses that are not retroactively reimbursed, not considered recurring, and in many cases are not eligible for reimbursement. This is the #1 reason why claims go into development.

#### What we did

* 2024
  * Conducted a [usability test](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024%2002%20Pension%20Usability%20Evaluation/research-findings.md) of the pension form's MVP, documented findings related to this step
* 2025
  * Conducted [VSO research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/pension/research/2024-09%20527EZ%20VSO%20Research) to further understand pain points in the application process
  * [Explored potential designs](https://www.figma.com/design/i7CyrMbAOuR78vhwvfvUrn/Archive---21P-527EZ---Pension-Benefits?node-id=53-3) and language changes (before multiple page list-and-loop pattern was established)
* 2026
  * Reviewed historical artifacts and the digitized 8416 to propose recommendations

#### Why it was stopped

This work has historically been deprioritized for several reasons. The multiple page list-and-loop pattern was being formalized, our priorities shifted to digitizing the 0969 form, and the BIO Huntridge team took on digitizing the 8416, which is redundant to this step's requirements. 

#### Next steps

* Collaborate with C/IA to further define care expenses vs. medical expenses
  * Evaluate Veterans' comprehension of this distinction
* Apply the [multiple page list-and-loop](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/multiple-responses) pattern to the step
* Review our [design brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/design/unreimbursed-care-and-medical-expenses-brief.md) for more details and recommended enhancements

### Embedding the 0969 in the pension form

#### Problem it solves  

Veterans don’t complete the required income and asset statement with their pension application, which leads to their claim going into development for additional evidence. This is the #3 reason why claims go into development.

#### What we did

* An audit to compare the 0969 form with the **Financial information** step in the pension application
* Addressed and resolved questions with VBA for clarification
* Met from the 526 team and the 1010-D team for their approaches to forms-within-forms and what they've learned from it
* Identified features for an MVP and potential enhancements
  All of these notes are available in a [Mural board here](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1745620624724/70ee36c200a3b66b426c33aa189dcdcc5a4a0192?wid=0-1763522503702)  .

#### Why it was stopped  

We conducted discovery relatively recently and wanted to avoid partial design or implementation for this large initiative.

#### Next step

* Review our [design brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/design/embedded-0969-brief.md#design-brief--embedding-the-0969-into-the-527ez) and its recommended scope to define an MVP. This document includes both design enhancements and spikes to evaluate technical feasibility and approach.
