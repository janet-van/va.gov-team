# 0969 Transition Hub

**Updated March 2026**

> The purpose of this transition document is to outline the current state of 0969 forms' product development. It serves as a "front door" to documentation and resources collected during the course of product design and development from March 2025 through March 2026. Included are links to more specific transition hubs where you can find direct links to resources and references used during design and development. These Transition Docs are "point in time" documents, and may not reflect current progress, deployments or upcoming efforts.

## Product context 

- The online **21P-0969** form allows Veterans to fill out and submit the Income and Asset Statement for Pension or Parents’ Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) Claims. Applicants use VA Form 21P-0969 when instructed to while completing VA Forms 21P-527EZ or 21P-534EZ.  They can also submit it when you need to verify or update your income or net worth. If you need to report changes over multiple years, submit a separate VA Form 21P-0969 each year.

### Design and research artifacts

These files capture the post-MVP designs, primarily with enhanced content as a collaboration and review with C/IA. The content changes further explain each type of income to report, how we consider dependents based on the claimant type, and improvements to the list-and-loop structure for clarity.

## Roadmap

### Done (recently)

-  [0969 Post MVP improvements](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/121584) - Improvements to the content and format of the Income and Asset statement focused on plain language updates and content chunking to ease form filling burden. Released 3/4/26.
-  0969 Income and Asset Statement - [update access path](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/116616). As part of the staggered launch of the online 0969 MVP, the link to the online form from the 0969 About page, did not take the user directly to the application but instead to the supporting forms for claims page. This update implemented the direct path to the application.
 -  **[LOA3 Authentication for 0969](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/16662)** - 0969 now requires authentication for all users. Released December 2025.


### Next

- [BPDS integration for 0969](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/121601)- Simplifies backend processing. POI (Pension Optimization Initiative) automation process would be able to more efficiently automate processing of 0969 applications and veterans would receive their benefits faster. Status as of 3/27/26: test transactions provided to VBA/VBMS teams.  No known technical questions or issues, BPDS team directed business questions to P&F team on 3/26.

#### Embedding the 0969 in the pension form

##### Problem it solves  

Veterans don’t complete the required income and asset statement with their pension application, which leads to their claim going into development for additional evidence. This is the #3 reason why claims go into development.

##### What we did

* An audit to compare the 0969 form with the **Financial information** step in the pension application
* Addressed and resolved questions with VBA for clarification
* Met from the 526 team and the 1010-D team for their approaches to forms-within-forms and what they've learned from it
* Identified features for an MVP and potential enhancements
  All of these notes are available in a [Mural board here](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1742317253841/97b5418bfc632a580dcc642e3275900a98e743e3?wid=0-1769466388784).

##### Why it was stopped  

We conducted discovery relatively recently and wanted to avoid partial design or implementation for this large initiative.

##### Next step

* Review our [design brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/design/embedded-0969-brief.md#design-brief--embedding-the-0969-into-the-527ez) and its recommended scope to define an MVP. This document includes both design enhancements and spikes to evaluate technical feasibility and approach.

### Later

The tickets in the milestone primarily consist of front-end enhnacements to apply the latest design patterns and components to the form and small content fixes for consistency.
