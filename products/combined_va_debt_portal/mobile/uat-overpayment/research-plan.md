	# Research Plan for Mobile Feature Support, Debt Portal: Overpayments in mobile app UAT, April 2026

## Background 🏗️

This study is a User Acceptance Test (UAT) for the VA mobile app’s Overpayments experience. The goal of this UAT is to confirm that the Overpayments feature is ready for production release by validating that the experience works as intended for Veterans using real account data in a pre-release build of the app.

Benefit overpayment debt can occur when a Veteran receives more compensation than they are entitled to at a given time. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) manages this debt. Examples include changes to dependent status (e.g., after a divorce a divorce) and receiving education benefits for a class and then dropping the class.

Veterans who have benefit overpayment debt can currently access overpayment information through the authenticated experience on VA.gov. The VA mobile app does not currently provide debt-related information or actions. This release introduces Overpayments as the first debt capability in the mobile app (Copays will be released separately at a later date).

`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

The mobile app does not have any debt-related information for Veterans to access. The goal is to let Veterans see totals and details for overpayment debts in the app.
  
`Where is your product situated on the VA Mobile App?`

In the authenticated section of the VA Mobile App, added to the existing "Payments" tab.
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

Veterans currently manage their debt on VA.gov; this will be a new addition to the mobile app.

](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/mobile/research-findings.md)

**Relevant Key Takeaways from Previous Research:**
1. Despite their frustrations with the payment process on mobile, participants preferred having this option over a version that only allowed viewing debt and bills.
5. Digital statements and documents are a core need for users.
6. Separation of current and resolved debt is beneficial for clarity.
7. Users want a clear, centralized way to manage their debt and bills.


### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

`Objective 1:  VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

Are there moments that matter?
	
- `Starting Up (Moment: Balancing Finances)`
- `Taking Care of Myself (Moment: Maintaining my health)`
- `Putting Down Roots (Moment: Maintaining my financial, social, and emotional health)`
- `Retiring (Moment: Taking care of my health)`
- `Aging (Moment that Matters: Managing my declining health)`


## Research Goals 🥅	

The purpose of this User Acceptance Testing (UAT) study is to verify that all elements of the Overpayments functionality operate as intended for Veterans using real data. Unlike usability testing, UAT focuses on confirming that features work as expected, rather than on users’ ability to find or discover them.

Specifically, this study will validate that Veterans can successfully view, manage, and resolve overpayments using the app, meeting all criteria outlined in the defined user paths.

  
### Outcome

Findings from this research will confirm whether the Overpayments functionality is fully ready for production release. If all success criteria are met, we will proceed with launch and communicate readiness to stakeholders. If any issues are identified, we will prioritize and resolve them before deployment.

### Hypotheses

- Users will be able to view, manage, and resolve their overpayments using the Overpayment feature.
- Users will access overpayment information, complete key actions, and navigate between screens without issues.
- The Overpayments functionality will operate correctly and meet all success criteria during user acceptance testing.

  
## Methodology  🛠️

This study will use moderated remote User Acceptance Testing (UAT) sessions with Veterans. Participants will join a remote session where a facilitator guides them through realistic overpayment management scenarios using a pre-release version of the app, logged in with their own credentials.

This method is appropriate because the overpayments feature is in its final phase of development and must be validated with real user data to confirm everything functions as intended. Previous usability studies have already assessed how users find and navigate the app, so this study will focus exclusively on verifying that the overpayments feature performs as expected in real-world situations.
