# Engineering and Security Checklist

## Instructions

Your document should be brief and high-level.  Please keep it to a single page.  Focus on the high level and link to supporting material where appropriate; this is _not_ a detailed engineering spec.

Some of the items below may not apply to your work--that's okay.  You may not be able to fill in some items that _do_ apply to your work--that's also okay.  If you don't have answers, please come to the Architecture Intent ready to ask questions.

More information about Engineering and Security standards is available in the [Launch-Blocking Security Issues section](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/platform-security-and-authority-to-operate-ato#PlatformSecurityandAuthoritytoOperate(ATO)-Launch-BlockingSecurityIssues) of the [Platform Security and Authority to Operate document](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/platform-security-and-authority-to-operate-ato) on Platform website.

## Security Review Checklists

Please complete all of Part 1 before submitting for Architechture Intent Review. Part 2 will be due before Staging Review.

## Part 1: Architecture Review Checklist

*Purpose: Validate security design decisions before implementation begins*

### 1. Product Overview

- [x] **Problem Statement**: What problem does this product/feature solve?

## Problem statement
**Background**

Ask VA users are internally classified by two distinct personas, using Ask VA as a personal user or a business user/veteran liaison.  The current user experience does not promote an obvious distinction between these two users and offers categories and topics that are not relevant for the different user types.  The existing UI experience leads to user confusion on how to complete the form to submit a question.   Additionally, because the two user types are entangled throughout the existing experience there is back end code complexity that should be reduced.

It is not clear to a business user the form options that should be selected to ensure their inquiry is categorized as "business" vs. "personal" so that it is routed property to AVA CRM agents

Current [business vs. personal rules](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/Fields,%20options%20and%20labels/Business%20vs.%20Personal.md) (unknown to the Ask VA user).

|User Type|Primary Issues|
|:---|:---|
|Personal User|Category and topic lists offer selection reassurance to this user, but the amount of current options causes overload to the user.|
|Business User|Category and topic lists are burdonsome because this user repeats the same selection(s) when using Ask VA.|
|Business User|Current required fields are not neccessary for this user to submit inquiries (i.e. - subject field), forcing additional and duplicative data entry which reduces the user's workflow efficiency.|

**End State Solution**

Decouple the existing form flow into two distinct personal and business user form flows.  Implement a business user form flow tailored to business user needs with focus on minimizing repetative data entry.  Implement a personal user form flow tailored to personal user needs with focus on user experience assurance while reducing category and topic lists overload.

- [ ] **Scope Definition**: Which portions of the architecture are in-scope for this review?

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] Is this feature authenticated or unauthenticated?
- [ ] If authenticated, document the authentication flow in the sequence diagram
- [ ] What authorization model is used (RBAC, ABAC, etc.)?

**Authenticated Experience Team Questions**
- [ ] Are you adding a product or feature to My VA or profile?
- [ ] Will your product write back or read from any information in profile?
- [ ] Do any of your APIs integrate with My VA or profile?

If you answered yes to any of the Authenticated Experience Team Questions, please contact the Authenticated Experience Team via their slack channel, [#accountexp-authexp](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB)

### 3. Data Classification

- [ ] What data is collected or used?
- [ ] Is PHI (Personal Health Information) captured?
  - [ ] Encryption approach documented
- [ ] Is PII (Personally Identifiable Information) captured?
  - [ ] Encryption approach documented
- [ ] Is other PI (Personal Information) captured?
  - [ ] Can sensitive information be scrubbed?

### 4. Cookies & Session Management

- [ ] Are cookies being used?
  - [ ] New cookies: Justify why existing cookies cannot be reused
  - [ ] Modified cookies: Document the changes
  - [ ] Existing cookies: Confirm intended behavior

### 5. API Endpoints

- [ ] List all new application endpoints (front-end and back-end)
- [ ] For each endpoint, document:
  - [ ] Potential abuse scenarios by unauthorized parties
  - [ ] Mitigation plan for each abuse scenario

### 6. Logging Strategy

- [ ] Is new logging data being captured?
  - [ ] What data is captured?
  - [ ] How is it captured?
  - [ ] Where is it stored?
  - [ ] Confirm no sensitive data in logs

### 7. Security Approach

- [ ] Document security implementations considered
- [ ] Document the chosen approach with rationale
- [ ] Identify any new libraries or components not yet in the codebase
  - [ ] Selection criteria and justification

### 8. AI Governance
- [ ] Does this software meet the [definition of AI](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/oitchiefaiofficerteam/SitePages/AI-Inventory.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=TBIcEf) to be included in the AI Use Case Inventory?
    - [ ] If yes, please list the AI Use Case ID and date of submission to the AI Inventory. The AI Governance team will provide you an AI Use Case ID via email upon submission of the [AI Use Case Intake form](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/oitchiefaiofficerteam/SitePages/AI-Inventory.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=TBIcEf). If you have other questions, contact [OITAIInventory@va.gov](mailto:OITAIInventory@va.gov)
