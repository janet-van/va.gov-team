# Release Plan: Find a Representative V3

Feature Toggle/flag:
`find_a_representative_enabled` will control visibility of the VSO Search Filter feature, for Find a Represenatative. This will be disabled in Production prior to release.

### Preparation
- [X] Contact Center Review has been submitted
- [X] The following user flows have been tested
   - Combo-box Functionality

      -    [X] Combo box filters out any `zzz` VSOs
      -    [X] Combo box allows you to type ahead & will begin filtering, as well as click on the drop down to see all VSOs
      -    [X] ~~`combo box will clear when search button is clicked if a VSO selection has not been made`~~
               - Due to issues with the components from the design system we will not be able to clear out the combo box as originally planned.

      -    [X] Use my location button is showing as expected
      -    [X] Search results note is appearing and accurate; e.g. `"Showing 15 of 25  results for 'accredited VSO represenative", "Arizona Department of Veterans Services" within "50 miles" of "New York, New York 10001" sorted by "Distance[closest to furthers"`
      -    [X] Ensure `sort by` button was removed and you can now sort just by updating that drop down
      -    [X] Ensure the Name/Mileage on the contact cards align with figma designs
      -    [X] Ensure the icons align with the figma designs.
   - Accessability Testing
      -    [X] Accessability has been tested and any findings have been documented.

- [X] Datadog monitoring is set up to track errors for combo box and search.
- [ ] Google Analytics is set up to track specific search parameters. -- **_Actively working on this with the Analytics team.  GA tracking is already set up but ~1 month out from DOMO_**

## Rollback Process

While we cannot think of any events that would be critical enough to merit a rollback, the following rollback process has been outlined just in case we need it.

**The rollback process is:**
1. Turn off the feature toggle `find_a_representative_enabled` 
   1. Submit a PR
2. Alert the team in [#benefits-accredited-rep-crew](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05SUUM4GAW) that the rollback process has been initiated
   1. Include any details as to what triggered the rollback
   2. Tag relevant teammates
3. Create a ticket to document ( [Ref.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/tree/master/Postmortems#instructions-for-creating-a-new-postmortem) for current Postmortem process):
   1. A summary of what caused the rollback process
   2. Confirmation that the feature toggle has been turned off (or that a PR has been submitted)
   3. Next step ideas for solving the rollback trigger
   4. Other relevant links/images
   5. Link to initial Slack alert for reference
