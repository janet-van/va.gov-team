# Background Context
background:
  problem_statement: "VSO representatives need a modern, efficient way to submit claims and evidence online. Currently, they mail, fax, or use legacy tools. ARP v1 enables digital submission of form 21-686c (Add Dependents) with PDF download, upload, and submission history tracking."

  current_solutions: "Mail, fax, QuickSubmit, Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP), third-party tools"

# Research Design

# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Evaluate usability and value of ARP’s 686c claim submission. Is it intuitive, clear, and easy to use? What could be improved?"
  - goal_2: "Evaluate the usability and value of a submissions history view. What is valuable for a representative to reference at a glance? What could be improved?"
  - goal_3: "Understand how representatives, including cross-accredited ones, typically submit 686c and other forms. How could this impact future designs?"

research_questions:
  - "What are the initial expectations of ARP form submission?"
  - "Can representatives complete tasks quickly and efficiently through this design, or could it be improved?"
  - "Is the information and amount of instruction clearly presented throughout the flow, or are there any points of confusion?"
  - "Are the multiple file upload instructions clear?"
  - "Is the navigation clear?"
  - "How does our v1 686c submission compare to their current solutions?"
  - "Are the statuses and their meaning clear?"
  - "How does the submission history view compare to their current solution?"

hypotheses:
  - "The v1 claims submission tool is intuitive and easy to use"
  - "The v1 solution for submitting 686c is not valuable in the current state because it does not auto-establish in VBMS"
  - "The submission history view helps give confidence in ARP, but representatives will not all information shown in the prototype"
  - "The level of instruction provided is unnecessary"

expected_outcomes: "This research will inform any edits to the Claims Submission v1 design to improve its ease and clarity. It will also inform future iterations of claims submission."

# Research Plan for Claims Submission v1 (686c) Usability Testing

April 2025

## Background

The Accredited Representative Facing (ARF) Team is building an Accredited Representative Portal (ARP) that will allow Veteran Service Organization (VSO) representatives to submit online any claim and supporting evidence to the VA. For v1 of ARP’s claim submission feature, we are allowing representatives to submit form 21-686c Add Dependents and view their submission history.

To submit a form 21-686c, we expect that users start from the form submissions landing page and download a PDF of the selected form, fill it out, upload the form and evidence and then submit. They will be able to confirm their submission on the final page of the form upload and view their prior submissions for all claimants.

## Research Goals

* Evaluate usability and value of ARP’s 686c claim submission. Is it intuitive, clear, and easy to use? What could be improved?
* Evaluate the usability and value of a submissions history view. What is valuable for a representative to reference at a glance? What could be improved?
* Understand how representatives, including cross-accredited ones, typically submit 686c and other forms. How could this impact future designs?

## Research Questions

Goal: Evaluate usability and value of ARP’s 686c claim submission. Is it intuitive, clear, and easy to use? What could be improved?

* What are the initial expectations of ARP form submission?
* Can representatives complete tasks quickly and efficiently through this design, or could it be improved?
* Is the information and amount of instruction clearly presented throughout the flow, or are there any points of confusion?
* Are the multiple file upload instructions clear?
* Is the navigation clear?
* How does our v1 686c submission compare to their current solutions?

Goal: Evaluate the usability and value of a submissions history view. What is valuable for a representative to reference at a glance? What could be improved?

* Are the statuses and their meaning clear?
* How does the submission history view compare to their current solution?
* What is a must-have, nice-to-have, and not needed for a submission history view?

Goal: Understand how representatives, including cross-accredited ones, typically submit 686c and other forms. How could this impact future designs?

* What does their workflow look like?
* What tools do they use and why?
* How does cross-accreditation impact how they submit claims, if at all?

## Hypotheses

Representatives will find

* The v1 claims submission tool is intuitive and easy to use
* The v1 solution for submitting 686c is not valuable in the current state because it does not auto-establish in VBMS
* The submission history view helps give confidence in ARP, but representatives will not all information shown in the prototype
* The level of instruction provided is unnecessary

## Outcome

This research will inform any edits to the Claims Submission v1 design to improve its ease and clarity. It will also inform future iterations of claims submission.

## Methodology

Semi-structured interviews and concept testing.
