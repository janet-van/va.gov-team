# Research Plan for Find Claimant, Claimant Page and Navigation

June 2025

## Background

The Accredited Representative Facing (ARF) Team is building an Accredited Representative Portal (ARP) that will allow Veteran Service Organization (VSO) representatives to submit online any claim and supporting evidence to the VA. Currently, representatives mail, fax, use QuickSubmit, Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP) or third-party tools to submit claims and evidence.

In this version of ARP that we are testing, representatives search for a specific claimant which then leads them to a Claimant Page. From this page they can submit a claim, view claimant information, view representation requests, or view claimant’s submission history. In this version, the navigation only shows “Find Claimant,” “Representative requests,” and “Help,” with “Your recent history” as part of a dropdown menu underneath the representative’s name.

## Research Goals

* Evaluate the usability of the search. Is it clear and intuitive? What could be improved?
* Evaluate the value of the Claimant Page overview. Is the information useful? What could improve its value?
* Evaluate the clarity and value of the claim submission flow, starting from Claimant Page. What could be improved?
* Evaluate the navigation. Are the sections and their purpose clear?

## Research Questions

Goal: Evaluate the usability of the search. Is it clear and intuitive? What could be improved?

* Do people expect to land on the search page after logging in?
* What do reps search by to find an individual in existing tools? What method do they prefer?
* What do people expect to see next after clicking “search?”

Goal: Evaluate the value of the Claimant Page overview. Is the information useful? What could improve its value?

* Is the information on the claimant overview must have/nice to have/not needed? What other information would be helpful to see?
* Are the alerts relevant and clear? What other alerts/notifications would they want to see for a claimant?

Goal: Evaluate the clarity and value of the claim submission flow, starting from Claimant Page. What could be improved?

* What do they expect to see next after selecting “Start [Form number] submission”?
* Do they understand differences in how submitted files will be processed?
* What would their next step be after submitting files?
* Is this version of submitting a claim better and faster than their current solution? Why or why not?

Goal: Evaluate the navigation. Are the sections and their purpose clear?

* When given scenarios, will a representative know which navigation section to visit, to take action? (Note: The following question(s) would be asked prior to giving the participant scenarios for Find Claimant and Claimant page.)
* Are the section headings clear? How confident do they feel in navigating the app?

## Hypotheses

Representatives will find

* Searching by last four digits of SSN, first name and last name will feel like an appropriate amount of information to enter.
* Information on the claimant overview page helps answer questions the representative has about the claimant; it is useful.
* The solution for submitting the form through Claimant Page is perceived as an equal to QuickSubmit.
* Each participant can complete 75% of the navigation tasks successfully.

## Outcome

This research will inform edits to Find Claimant, Claimant page, and the Claim Submission flow. It will also inform future iterations of claims submission.

## Methodology
