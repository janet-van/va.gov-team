# VA.gov Search Feedback — Combined Qualitative Analysis

**Source file:** search-survey-030926-redacted.md
**Total rows analyzed:** ~3,815
**URL categories:** `/search/` (VA.gov site search), `/find-locations/` (Facility Locator), `/find-locations/facility/` (specific facility pages), `/forms/` (Find a VA Form)
**Context:** Informing a transition from keyword-based search (Search.gov) to a modern semantic search platform

## ZERO & 999 RESULTS FLAG

Responses where Veterans explicitly reported zero results, 999 results, or result overload:

- "We didn't find any results for ICD-9-CM 799.9. Try using different words or checking the spelling of the words you're using." — /search/ — Row 2200
- "Did another search for online means test in 's and didn't get any results! Seems like your search is [redacted] or purposely designed to make people not use it." — /search/ — Row 2349
- "I searched for HOW to transfer to another VA medical facility and received '0' results." — /search/ — Row 2685
- "The How to Correct Date of Birth had 999 answers which at least started the same as other quires which was not applicable. Terrible search software." — /search/ — Row 2992
- "Searching website at top of page in '/search/' for VA Community care phone number, ZERO results populated." — /search/ — Row 3453
- "Initially I was able to find what I was looking for, but once I created an account, it came back with 444 results for a replacement healthcare card, in which none so far has addressed the issue." — /search/ — Query: replacement healthcare card

**Implication for semantic search transition:** Both failure modes — zero results and undifferentiated bulk results — are characteristic of pure keyword matching with no semantic fallback. A semantic engine would surface conceptually related content even for partial or mismatched queries, and would rank results by relevance rather than returning an unordered result set.

## THEME 1 — INTENT & RELEVANCY

**Description:** The site search engine matches query tokens but not query intent, returning press releases, news articles, CPAP instructions instead of lab orders, and chemotherapy pages instead of tax abatement letters. Veterans describe result sets of 14+ pages with no date sorting, results matching one word of a multi-word phrase, and consistently turning to Google as a workaround. The engine also produces non-deterministic results — the same query typed verbatim returns different results on a second attempt.

**Frequency:** 30+ responses

**Agent doing some spitballing**
1. Deploy semantic/vector-based ranking that interprets query intent rather than token overlap. Queries like "how do I transfer to another VA medical facility" should return transfer process pages, not zero results. "Chronic adjustment disorder" should return mental health condition pages, not generic mental health content.
2. Implement a direct-answer / featured-snippet layer for highest-frequency query types — phone numbers, hours, form instructions, eligibility criteria — surfaced above organic results.
3. Suppress or de-rank press releases and news articles when query signals indicate transactional or navigational intent.
4. Treat multi-word queries as phrases. "Pharmacy hours" should not match every page containing either word independently.
5. Make search results deterministic. The same verbatim query should return the same results on repeated attempts.
6. Add date-sorting and result-count controls for all result pages. A 14-page result set with no sorting options is not usable.

## THEME 2 — INFO VS. ACTION

**Description:** Veterans arrive trying to complete specific tasks — enroll, upload evidence, submit a claim, refill a prescription, check status, schedule an appointment — and receive informational articles about those tasks instead of direct pathways to complete them. Broken upload flows (404s), a CHAMPVA application that redirects to the homepage, and an inability to schedule specialty appointments online are the most frequently cited specific failures. Veterans also cannot find tools like Quick Submit, the travel pay portal, or appointment check-in through site search.

**Agent doing some spitballing**
1. Classify queries by intent type at the search layer — transactional (do something), navigational (go somewhere), informational (learn something) — and serve task-completion widgets or deep links rather than content articles for transactional queries.
2. Add a dental facility type to the Facility Locator service-type dropdown; this gap is independently cited by at least three Veterans.
3. Surface a direct "Schedule appointment" CTA or callback number when search or Facility Locator detects appointment-seeking intent.
4. Audit all search-result deep links for broken destinations (404s) before deploying semantic search — bad links compound the relevancy failure.
5. Make CHAMPVA and enrollment application entry points directly findable from search, not only from within the enrollment workflow.

## THEME 3 — FACILITIES & CONTACTS

**Description:** The Facility Locator data is chronically stale across every facility type — VA health, community care, urgent care, pharmacy, vet center. Veterans report permanently closed locations, phone numbers that connect to spam or unrelated businesses, providers listed years after they left, contracted urgent care clinics that have terminated their VA contracts, and incorrect addresses. This is a systemic data quality and currency failure. At least one Veteran notes the inaccuracies "could be life threatening." Veterans are also unable to find community care providers by name and cannot locate contact information for specific VA offices through site search.

**Frequency:** 35+ responses

**Direct Quotes:**

**Agent doing some spitballing**
1. Implement a continuous data-verification pipeline for community care and urgent care contract status. Provider contracts change frequently; the display must reflect current contract status, not last-import status.
2. Add a user-accessible "Report incorrect information" button on every Facility Locator result card with a structured intake form routed to the data owner. Veterans are already providing corrections — they have no structured channel.
3. Deduplicate location records before display (duplicate addresses are appearing as separate results).
4. Audit provider listings for recency. A provider listing that is 7 years stale represents a systemic MDM failure, not an edge case.
5. Display a "Last verified" date on each listing so Veterans can assess data currency themselves.
6. Enable community care provider search by provider name, not only by geography and facility type.

## THEME 4 — FRAGMENTATION

**Description:** Veterans experience VA.gov as a collection of disconnected systems — VA.gov, My HealtheVet, eBenefits, Login.gov — each with separate logins, URLs, and information architectures. When systems are migrated, Veterans lose previously working features (medication photos, Blue Button reports, secure messaging, prescription tracking) with no meaningful transition guidance. The recurring phrase "the old system worked" reflects a concrete loss of capability, not nostalgia. Veterans are also sent in circular loops between systems that each redirect to the other.

**Frequency:** 20+ responses

- "The problem is that it is so complicated to find and use anything of interest. It may be OK for the younger people who know what they are doing, we older GI's are lost. By the time I find what, used to be easy I can't remember why I wanted it. You've turned something that was easy to use into the unusable." — /search/ — Query: VA SECURE MESSAGES

**Agent doing some spitballing**
1. Implement a federated search layer that queries across VA.gov, My HealtheVet, and eBenefits and surfaces results from any system in a single results page. Veterans should not need to know which sub-system holds their prescription history.
2. When a feature moves or is retired, the search index should resolve legacy terms (e.g., "Blue Button," "MyHealtheVet prescription refill") to the new canonical location rather than a no-results page.
3. Consolidate the login entry point. Login.gov, ID.me, DS Logon, and My HealtheVet credentials appearing as separate choices requiring Veterans to know which one applies to which task is a primary access barrier.
4. Maintain a persistent, publicly accessible "what changed and where did it go" page for all platform migrations, linked from search results for affected query terms.
5. Synchronize guidance between phone staff and the website. Veterans following phone instructions and hitting dead ends on the site is a systemic failure, not a training problem.

## THEME 5 — ACCESSIBILITY & DIGITAL LITERACY GAP

**Description:** A distinct sub-population of Veterans — older Veterans, those with visual impairments, and those with low digital literacy — are explicitly blocked by the site's complexity in ways that go beyond general frustration. These Veterans are not describing a system that changed; they are describing a system that was never designed for them. Login fragmentation, multi-step navigation, and search results that return lists instead of direct answers are the primary barriers cited. This theme is distinct from Fragmentation because the cause is not a migration — it is a design mismatch.

**Frequency:** 10+ responses

**Direct Quotes:**

- "NOT VISUALLY IMPAIRED ACCOMMODATING" — /search/ — Query: KEARNY MESA
- "My husband can't find his DD214 because he can't see out of one eye, and I can't get a copy being his wife." — /search/ — Query: dd214
- "HAVING TROUBLE NAVIGATING THROUGH THE PORTALS SEEMS LIKE VA THINKS THAT EVERYONE IS A TECH GENIUS." — /search/ — Query: BTSSS
- "The problem is that it is so complicated to find and use anything of interest. It may be OK for the younger people who know what they are doing, we older GI's are lost. By the time I find what, used to be easy I can't remember why I wanted it." — /search/ — Query: VA SECURE MESSAGES
- "with the changes to medication lists I would hate to be a non-IT person trying to use it! Its confusing and very difficult to search or use." — /search/ — Query: quick submit
- "The login process is too lengthy and confusing. I do not know who tampered with this, but it is not old people friendly." — /find-locations/ — Row 3610
- "The old system worked just fine... God you screwed this up and I have technical knowledge. What about our older vets." — /find-locations/ — Row 3398

**Agent doing some spitballing**
1. A direct-answer layer — returning a phone number, hours, or a single deep link rather than a list of results — reduces cognitive load for the population most harmed by current search behavior, without requiring Veterans to evaluate relevance themselves.
2. Prioritize plain-language result snippets and clear action labels over document titles in result displays.
3. Audit the site against WCAG 2.1 AA standards with particular attention to screen-reader compatibility. The "NOT VISUALLY IMPAIRED ACCOMMODATING" response suggests at least one Veteran attempted to use assistive technology and found it unsupported.

## THEME 6 — TAX & FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

**Description:** A high-concentration cluster of Veterans trying to retrieve 1099-Rs, tax statements, EOBs, and benefit verification letters — documents with hard external deadlines (tax filing, housing applications, DMV). These are not general search failures; they are failures at a predictable, high-volume, time-bound query type that should be solvable with a direct authenticated document link. Veterans coming from the `/forms/` URL indicate they are already using the correct tool and still cannot locate the document. This is a seasonal amplification of the Info vs. Action theme that warrants its own platform-level response.

**Frequency:** 8+ responses in this dataset; volume likely significantly higher during tax season

**Direct Quotes:**

- "No way to retrieve OPM claim number to view 1099r form" — /search/ — Query: 1099r
- "Find 1099r" — FORMS — Query: 1099
- "Can't find 1099 anywhere, I've clicked all the links my clicker can click. Neither Searches or perusing could I find anything even remotely related. None of the options fit. At least SSA had all their info easily found, messaged to me it was ready, and instant, no wait." — /search/ — Query: 1099
- "This website is a piece of [redacted]. Can not answer a simple question about a 1099 form." — /search/ — Query: 1099-R form
- "It's tax season. I'm trying to find the tax statement 2025 for survivor beneficiary. Or are you going to mail it? Just asking." — FORMS — Query: tax statement 2025
- "I was looking for the Tax Abatement Letter for myself needed for my DMV wounded warrior placard. I was sent to a page for 'My Chemotherapy Treatment.'" — /search/ — Query: tax abatement letter
- "I am trying to find EOB's for my practice but can't seem to do this online like I hoped to be able to do." — /search/ — Query: eob
- "I'm trying to get my benefit letter and it will not let me. I have tried multiple times. I called in as well and there is no option for printing. I need it for housing. Everything is so difficult with your site." — /search/ — Query: email my benefits letter

**Agent doing some spitballing**
1. Create a dedicated, authenticated "My Documents" entry point that surfaces 1099-R, tax statements, benefit verification letters, and EOBs in one place, and make it directly findable from site search for queries like "1099," "tax statement," and "benefit letter."
2. Configure the search engine to recognize seasonal spikes in document-retrieval queries and surface the authenticated document portal as the top result, above any informational content.
3. Align with SSA's model: proactively notify Veterans via email when their 1099-R or tax statement is available, with a direct authenticated link — eliminating the search need entirely for this document type.

## TECHNICAL ISSUES & BUGS

**Theme: Facility Locator Extended Outage**

**Description:** The Facility Locator experienced a prolonged outage — complaints span from "weeks" to "over a year" — during the survey period. Dozens of Veterans hit a "down for maintenance" message and could not find VA locations, urgent care, or community care providers, directly blocking appointment scheduling and care access.

**Frequency:** 25+ responses

- "find an urgent care - this tool has been broken for weeks. please fix it" — /find-locations/ — Row 3747
- "get urgent care at authorized facility. web site down. not happy" — FIND LOCATION

**Theme: Broken Links, Form Failures, and Access Errors**

**Description:** Veterans encounter 404 errors on search-result destination pages, forms that will not load, broken download links, app crashes, browser incompatibility, and login failures.

**Frequency:** 10+ responses

**Direct Quotes:**

- "the lady on the helpline said i could upload my FOIA request here. i cant. i do a search for upload and the results says 'upload your documents' i click that link and the page says, page can not be found." — /search/ — Row 3813
- "I have tried multiple times to download a form 26-8791 that I need... it says the link doesn't work and to email the forms manager, which I have done twice and yet, I am still waiting for access to the form." — /search/ — Query: 26-8791
- "I'm trying to find information on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention... the links sent me back to myhealt.va.gov, which redirects me back to va.gov. It's a loop." — /search/ — Query: healthy living center
- "TERRIBLE software for both my MacBook Air and my iphone. I've had error messages, sites with no way to continue, several phone calls with no resolution. This is a fabulous example of ineptitude in government program management." — /search/ — Query: VHIC card
- "The search information has changed significantly when trying to find results for the VA National Golden Age Games Medical Clearance Form, 0926e. This form has always been accessible on this platform for the physicians to complete for their patients. PLEASE, refresh this search bar so that the VA doctors can complete this medical clearance document for their patients who need it when they register for the Golden Age Games. Mandatory Registration starts in less than two weeks." — /search/ — Query: National Golden Age Games
- "So many reasons. For starters this form barely works in Firefox." — /search/ — Query: CEP
- "We can't figure out how to navigate through the app" — /search/ — Query: decision letter
- "I rode my bike all the way out to the VA to change my direct deposit, based upon the hours of operation listed on THIS webpage. I get there and find out I now have to call a number and leave a message to schedule an appointment." — /find-locations/facility/vba_339f — Row 3748

**Agent doing some spitballing**
1. Implement a degraded-mode static fallback for the Facility Locator — even a cached list of VA facilities with last-known contact information — so Veterans are not left with a blank page when the primary system is down.
2. Establish and publish SLAs for Facility Locator uptime. The survey data spans over a year of complaints.
3. Implement real-time monitoring and automated alerting for 404 rates on all search-result destination pages and upload flow endpoints.
4. Audit all form download and document upload flows for broken links before any search platform migration. Broken downstream links will compound semantic search relevancy failures.

## CROSS-THEME PATTERNS

Responses that touched multiple themes simultaneously (highest severity):

- "We are in a local hospital ER now- Sunday- and I wanted to access my husband's list of medications. Or other info- where/ how do I do that?" — /search/ — **Themes: Info vs. Action + Technical Issues** — Time-critical medical context; no authenticated record access pathway surfaces through search.
- "the lady on the helpline said i could upload my FOIA request here. i cant. i do a search for upload and the results says 'upload your documents' i click that link and the page says, page can not be found." — /search/ — **Themes: Info vs. Action + Technical Issues** — Search surfaces a relevant-looking result; destination is a 404.
- "I'm trying to find information on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention... the links sent me back to myhealt.va.gov, which redirects me back to va.gov. It's a loop." — /search/ — **Themes: Fragmentation + Technical Issues** — Handbook URL is broken and search cannot compensate.
- "I'm trying to get my benefit letter and it will not let me. I have tried multiple times. I called in as well and there is no option for printing. I need it for housing." — /search/ — **Themes: Info vs. Action + Technical Issues + Tax & Financial Documents** — Hard external deadline (housing); every available channel is blocked.
- "ONCE, I searched for rules on travel reimbursement and got a document... I've typed the title per verbatim in the search block, and it doesn't show up again. the search engine seems to use its own key words." — /search/ — **Themes: Intent & Relevancy + Technical Issues** — Same query, different results; non-deterministic search behavior.
- "This website is not working with what I was told to do. I called regarding my daughters benefits for school and the person just said to click on chapter 35 which is not available" — /search/ — **Themes: Fragmentation + Info vs. Action** — Phone staff and website are out of sync; Veteran follows correct guidance and hits a dead end.
- "Community care says go on my healthevet to read print referrals But No my healthe vet It sits there curser spinning Va.gov spins" — /search/ — **Themes: Fragmentation + Technical Issues** — Cross-system referral loop fails at both ends.
- "I literally asked for a clinic's phone number, I got 10 pages of press releases." — /search/ — **Themes: Intent & Relevancy + Facilities & Contacts** — Search fails to surface contact data that is also likely stale in the Facility Locator.
- "Can't find 1099 anywhere... Navigation sucks, not intuitive... Used to work all the options on splash page." — /search/ — **Themes: Tax & Financial Documents + Fragmentation + Intent & Relevancy** — Time-sensitive document, site redesign removed the direct pathway, search cannot compensate.
- "My husband can't find his DD214 because he can't see out of one eye, and I can't get a copy being his wife." — /search/ — **Themes: Accessibility & Digital Literacy Gap + Info vs. Action** — Visual impairment and spousal access policy converge to create a complete blockage.
- "The problem is that it is so complicated to find and use anything of interest. It may be OK for the younger people who know what they are doing, we older GI's are lost." — /search/ — **Themes: Accessibility & Digital Literacy Gap + Fragmentation** — Site complexity is a design problem; migration made it worse for this population.

## SUMMARY

**Total responses analyzed:** ~3,815

**Theme breakdown (approximate):**

| Theme | Responses |
|---|---|
| Theme 1 — Intent & Relevancy | 30+ |
| Theme 2 — Info vs. Action | 40+ |
| Theme 3 — Facilities & Contacts | 35+ |
| Theme 4 — Fragmentation | 20+ |
| Theme 5 — Accessibility & Digital Literacy Gap | 10+ |
| Theme 6 — Tax & Financial Documents | 8+ (seasonally amplified) |
| Technical Issues & Bugs | 35+ |

**Top priorities for immediate action:**

1. **Facilities & Contacts data currency** — The highest-frequency theme with the only documented life-safety implication ("could be life threatening"). Veterans are being physically misdirected to closed clinics and clinics that deny care. No search platform improvement can compensate for fundamentally wrong underlying data. Data governance for community care, urgent care, and provider records must be resolved at the source before or concurrent with any platform migration. Community care data quality is measurably worse than VA-direct facility data.

2. **Intent & Relevancy / Info vs. Action** — The modal experience across the `/search/` portion of this dataset is a search engine that returns content matching query words but not query intent. The transition to semantic search directly addresses this. Intent classification (transactional vs. informational) and a direct-answer layer for high-frequency query types (phone numbers, hours, form links, document retrieval) would resolve the majority of cited failures without requiring Veterans to change their behavior.

3. **Facility Locator outage resilience** — Complaints about the Locator being unavailable span over a year of this dataset, blocking appointment scheduling and care access at scale. A degraded-mode fallback is a prerequisite for any platform that surfaces Facility data in search results. Surfacing a faster path to data that is simply unavailable does not help Veterans.

**Key transition signal:** The move from keyword-based search to a semantic platform directly addresses the most frequently cited failure: search returning results that match query words but not query intent. A semantic engine would have returned "means test enrollment form" for the query "means test online" instead of zero results; would have treated "chronic adjustment disorder" as an entity rather than three separate tokens; and would have surfaced a phone number or hours answer directly for "primary care call center hours" instead of 10 pages of press releases. These are not edge cases — they represent the modal search experience described in this dataset.
