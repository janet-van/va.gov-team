# Background Context
background:
  problem_statement: "Veterans need an easy way to keep their dependent spouses and children up-to-date on their disability and VA pension benefits to avoid overpayments and ensure compliance with the 8-year verification requirement. Current forms are difficult for users with assistive technology (AT) to navigate."
  product_location: "https://www.va.gov/manage-dependents/"
  user_familiarity: "Iteration - existing product with partial 2025 release of dependent picklist feature and digitized form 0538"
  product_brief_url: "https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/initiative_brief/Dependent%20Picklist%20Component.md"

# Research Design
methodology: "Usability testing with assistive technology users"
research_format: 
  location: remote
  moderated: true
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Assess the usability of the dependents management flow, identifying barriers for Veterans who use assistive technology."
  - goal_2: "Determine if Veterans who use assistive technology understand how to complete the verification process if they do have changes to make."
  - goal_3: "Understand the unique challenges AT users have with the cancel flow in the child add list+loop."

research_questions:
  - "What specific needs do AT users have when encountering errors and instructions in the picklist?"
  - "What barriers, if any, does the picklist pattern present to AT users?"
  - "What is the right amount of content in headers, labels, and links to assist users without impeding usability for AT users?"
  - "Can AT users make edits to their responses from the summary page?"
  - "What would Veterans expect to see or happen when they verify dependents?"
  - "Are Veterans using assistive technology able to understand that they need to go to a different form to make changes?"
  - "Can AT users navigate back to the verification form once they've made their changes in the 686?"
  - "Are any headers, labels, or links lacking description or clarity?"
  - "Do AT users understand where they have been returned to after cancelling? Does it align with their expectations, and if not, what would they expect?"
  - "What unique challenges might AT users experience with the cancel flow?"

hypotheses:
  - "Veterans who use assistive technology will be able to use the picklist pattern to remove dependents independently."
  - "AT users won't experience any additional difficulties from the 0538→686 transition, beyond those experienced by other user types."
  - "AT users will be able to understand and recover from errors."
  - "The friction included in the app to explain add/removal reasons won't impede AT users from completing their task, or be overly frustrating."
  - "The balance between context included in questions and hint text is right for AT users."

expected_outcomes: "Test 686 picklist and 0538 pathways with AT users before releasing to 100% in production. Insights will prioritize changes to the dependents management flow to make the form more accessible to various AT users and move toward OCTO Goal #1: making the digital experience the best way to access VA benefits by increasing Veteran satisfaction."

# Research Plan for Dependents Management Team -- AT testing of 686/0538 Dependent Management Flows


## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>

Veterans who receive disability compensation or pension may be eligible to add dependent spouses, children, and parents to their benefit, resulting in additional $$ on their payments each month for each dependent. 
If Veterans don’t keep their dependents up-to-date on their benefits, they could end up owing the VA money for overpayments once the VA eventually finds out. 
The VA also requires veterans to affirm their dependent status every 8 years – a process known as ‘dependent verification’. If a veteran doesn’t complete this process via form 0538, they may end up owing 8 years of overpayments, and their dependents will be removed (even if their dependents are correct!). Prior to 2025, veterans could only satisfy verification requirements by mail. We digitized part of the 0538 so most veterans can complete it online.
We want to help veterans keep their dependents accurate and avoid these overpayment scenarios by making it easy for them to update their dependents online. 

In 2025 we partially released 2 features:

1. A ‘dependent picklist’ feature intended to make it easier for veterans to REMOVE dependents from their benefit. 
2. The digitized form 0538, 

We want to test both pathways with AT users before releasing to 100% in production.

This is an existing product for auth users only.

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

> [!NOTE]
> Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

### Goals

`1.` **Assess the usability of the dependents management flow, identifying barriers for Veterans who use assistive technology.**

`2.` **Determine if Veterans who use assistive technology understand how to complete the verification process if they do have changes to make**

`3.` **Understand the unique challenges AT users have with the cancel flow in the child add list+loop** 
  
### Outcome

Research will help us prioritize changes to the dependents management flow that will make our form more accessible to a variety of AT users. Insights gathered will inform post-MVP enhancements to the features. These learnings will be relevant to other teams using the picklist pattern for releases in the future.

In relation to OCTO goals, this study will help us move toward making our digital experience the best way to access VA benefits (Priority #1) by increasing Veteran satisfaction with the digital 686/0538 (Key result 3.1).

### Research questions

Research Goal 1: Better understand how our end users understand and interact with the picklist pattern

* What specific needs do AT users have when encountering errors and instructions in the picklist?
* What barriers, if any, does the picklist pattern present to AT users?
* What is the right amount of content in headers, labels, and links to assist users without impeding usability for AT users?
* Can AT users make edits to their responses from the summary page?

Research Goal 2: Determine if Veterans who use assistive technology are able to successfully complete dependent verification

* What would Veterans expect to see/or to happen when they "verify dependents"?
* Are Veterans using assistive technology able to understand that they need to go to a different form to make changes?
* Can AT users navigate back to the verification form once they’ve made their changes in the 686?
* Are any headers, labels, or links lacking description or clarity?

Research Goal 3 : Assess how AT users would like the ‘cancel list+loop’ flow to function

* Do AT users understand where they have been returned to after cancelling? Does it align with their expectations, and if not, what would they expect?
* What unique challenges might AT users experience with the cancel flow?



### Hypotheses

* Veterans who use assistive technology will be able to use the picklist pattern to remove dependents independently
* AT users wont experience any additional difficulties from the 0538→686 transition, beyond those experienced by other user types
* AT users will be able to understand and recover from errors
* The friction we have included in the app to explain add/removal reasons wont impede AT users from completing their task, or be overly frustrating
* The balance between context we have included in questions and in hint text is right for AT users

    * Share a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey for this study, so we can review it before it goes out to participants and before the kickoff meeting?
    * Call participants one day in advance to remind them about the session and confirm they plan on using the AT they indicated during the session?
