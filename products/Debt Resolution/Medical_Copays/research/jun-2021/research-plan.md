# Background Context
background:
  problem_statement: "Veterans need access to their VA medical copay bills (Veteran Patient Statements) on VA.gov. Currently they can only access the last 6 months through AccessVA or MyHealtheVet, and Veterans expect all money owed to VA to be in a central location. The MVP is being scaled back to be a standalone tool similar to the existing Debt Portal."
  product_location: "VA.gov authenticated experience - standalone medical copayments tool"
  user_familiarity: "Iteration - testing scaled-back MVP after previous research"

# Research Design
methodology: "Usability testing"
research_format: 
  location: remote
  moderated: true
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Test lower-fidelity mobile-view prototype to gauge how well Veterans use the tool on mobile devices"
  - goal_2: "Validate design assumptions and uncover gaps in the medical copayments MVP"
  - goal_3: "Understand if Veterans can find relevant information about their bills and resolution options"

research_questions:
  - "Is the online tool card effective at communicating the tool and its use to the Veteran?"
  - "Do Veterans understand the concept of a referred charge and what to do about it?"
  - "Do Veterans understand how their charges and payments contribute to a balance for each facility?"
  - "How do Veterans expect to be able to interact with the charges and payments table, if at all?"
  - "Are the charge details included in the table relevant and complete?"
  - "Do Veterans understand how to view and resolve their bills?"
  - "Are Veterans able to find all of the relevant information they need about their debt?"
  - "Do Veterans understand their options for resolving their bills?"
  - "Do Veterans understand who to call if they have questions?"
  - "What do Veterans think about the wizard as a means to find resolution?"

hypotheses:
  - "Veterans will find and understand the tool available on the content page"
  - "Veterans may not fully understand the referred charges and may want to know more about which charges had been referred and what it means for them"
  - "Veterans may like seeing their charges separated by facility"
  - "Veterans may be confused why they can't pay their charges for all their facilities at once"
  - "Veterans may miss the simpler link for viewing their balance details, then be confused why the wizard doesn't show more information about their balance"
  - "Veterans will be able to find the information they need about their bill balances"
  - "Veterans will be able to find and understand their options, but Veterans may be frustrated with the wizard"

expected_outcomes: "Validate design hypotheses and identify gaps to improve the Medical Copayments MVP before launch"

# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Medical Copayments Usability

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.

## Goals

### What product & team are you doing this research for?:

Debt Resolution Team's Medical Copays

### Background: 

Our team is working to bring VA medical copay bills (Veteran Patient Statements) to VA.gov. Currently, Veterans are able to access the last 6 months of their statements through AccessVA directly or by MyHealtheVet link to AccessVA. In our previous research study ([readout](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/readout.md#debt-portal-copayment-enhancement-veteran-research-readout)), we learned that Veterans do generally expect all money owed to the VA to be found in a central location. Due to the authenticated experience team not being ready to accommodate a more expansive "financial hub" as initially proposed, we are scaling the Copayments MVP back to be a standalone tool very similar to the existing benefits [Debt Portal tool](https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/).  

With this round of research, we are looking to test a lower-fidelity mobile-view prototype of the Copayments MVP to gauge how well Veterans use the tool on mobile devices.

### Research questions: 

What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

* Is the online tool card effective at communicating the tool and its use to the Veteran?
* Do Veterans understand the concept of a referred charge and what to do about it?
* Do Veterans understand how their charges and payments contribute to a balance for each facility?
* How do Veterans expect to be able to interact with the charges and payments table, if at all?
* Are the charge details included in the table relevant and complete?
* Do Veterans understand how to view and resolve their bills?
* Are Veterans able to find all of the relevant information they need about their debt?
* Do Veterans understand their options for resolving their bills?
* Do Veterans understand who to call if they have questions?
* What do Veterans think about the wizard as a means to find resolution?

### Hypotheses: 

* Veterans will find and understand the tool available on the content page
* Veterans may not fully understand the referred charges and may want to know more about which charges had been referred and what it means for them
* Veterans may like seeing their charges separated by facility
* Veterans may be confused why they can't pay their charges for all their facilities at once
* Veterans may miss the simpler link for viewing their balance details, then be confused why the wizard doesn't show more information about their balance
* Veterans will be able to find the information they need about their bill balances
* Veterans will be able to find and understand their options, but Veterans may be frustrated with the wizard

## Method

### What method of research are you planning?

Remote, moderated sessions conducted on Zoom

* Usability testing with a UXPin prototype designed for mobile

#### Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?

* Usability testing will help us validate both our research hypotheses and design assumptions as well as uncover additional gaps

#### Where are you planning to do your research? 

Online, through Zoom

#### What will you be testing?
