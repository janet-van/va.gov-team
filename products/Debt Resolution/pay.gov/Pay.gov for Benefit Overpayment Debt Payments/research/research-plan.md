  user_familiarity: "Iteration on existing payment journey (improves current redirect-to-pay.va.gov experience by streamlining flow and prepopulating account information)."
  product_brief_url: "https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/pay.gov/Pay.gov%20for%20Benefit%20Overpayment%20Debt%20Payments/product%20outline.md"

# Research Design
methodology: "Mixed methods: semi-structured interviews + moderated usability testing"
research_format:
  location: remote
  moderated: true

# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand Veterans’ needs, expectations, and preferences for making payments, specifically (a) financial management behaviors (b) decision making around amounts and timelines (c) interest and challenges in automatic/recurring payments."
  - goal_2: "Test the usability of the Veteran’s overpayment debt experience in end-to-end flow testing (debt summary → details → resolve → choose payment option → Pay.gov HCP → confirmation)."

research_questions:
  - "What are Veterans’ current workflows and mental models for making payments on VA.gov?"
  - "What other comparable payment experiences do they prefer? Why?"
  - "What challenges or pain points do Veterans encounter in the current experience?"
  - "How easy is it to read and comprehend the pages?"
  - "Which aspects of the layout are most and least effective and why?"
  - "How does the experience compare to what they expected?"
  - "How confident and secure do they feel in the payment process? What creates confidence?"
  - "What factors influence Veterans’ decisions on payment amount/timeline (full vs partial vs plan)?"
  - "Do Veterans want recurring/auto-pay options? What trust/controls would they need?"
  - "Do Veterans notice/understand the transition and does it impact trust?"
  - "What parts of the flow are hardest to navigate with screen reader/magnifier and Zoom screen share?"

hypotheses:
  - "Veterans will prefer the more streamlined experience of hosted collection pages, including pre-populated account details and staying within the same browser."
  - "Veterans will be able to understand the difference between full and partial payment options and make a selection; if they hesitate or are unsure, we will identify what decision support (content, examples, explanations of consequences, or links to payment plans/financial help) is needed."
  - "Veterans will feel confident and secure that their payment has has been received in the new experience."
  - "Veterans will want more diverse payment methods for submitting payments, including interest in recurring payments and autopay."

expected_outcomes: "Identify how to iterate VA.gov pages and the VA.gov → Pay.gov transition to reduce confusion and manual entry, improve comprehension and usability of the end-to-end payment flow (including choosing full/partial/plan), and increase trust/confidence at confirmation—supporting future payment features and increasing online payment transactions while reducing analog transactions and drop-off."

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

The integration of Pay.gov Hosted Collection Pages aims to provide an easier, more seamless payment experience for Veterans. In the current experience, Veterans are redirected from the VA.gov “Resolve Overpayment” page to an external pay.va.gov tab and entry page, where they must manually enter their personal account information. Monthly Medallia feedback consistently describes this experience as confusing and painful, increasing cognitive load and leading to drop-off.  

The new design streamlines the user experience with Pay.gov hosted collection pages, presenting the VA.gov to Pay.gov payment journey as a continuous flow and prepopulating a user’s account information, thus removing the need for Veterans to manually enter debt information.
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

The new experience spans VA.gov auth pages with Pay.gov Hosted Collection Pages integration. When looking at an individual overpayment debt , the user will be able to select full, partial, or a payment plan within VA.gov, and then proceed to Pay.gov hosted collection pages within the same browser without having to reenter their account information. Next, they enter and review payment information, and finally arrive at a payment confirmation page on VA.gov
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**As described above, this iterates and improves upon the existing payment journey, to now include the ability to seamlessly process a payment for an overpayment debt directly from the va.gov experience without needing to navigate to a different site.**

**Key Takeaways from Previous Research:**
- `Cross-site redirects create high risk for confusion and drop-off, especially when Veterans have to leave the “primary” experience (e.g., app or VA.gov) to complete actions on pay.va.gov / Pay.gov; prior mobile debt research anticipated that Veterans would find redirection confusing and feel friction when completing tasks outside the originating experience.
Relevant past study: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/mobile/research-plan.md`
- `Veterans manage VA debt alongside other bills and prioritize actionability (due dates + next steps). Prior research indicates Veterans often think in terms of “what do I need to do next and by when,” rather than categorizing VA debt as a separate mental bucket—so this study should focus on whether the Pay.gov flow supports quick comprehension, clear next steps, and a strong sense of “payment completed successfully,” rather than only testing page usability in isolation.
Relevant past study: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/one_va_debt_letter/mobile/research-findings.md`
- `Trust and confidence come from transparency and specific details—not from format alone. Veterans’ trust is more closely tied to whether the experience provides clear, concrete information (what they owe, why they owe it, what will happen next, and proof/confirmation) than whether information is “combined” or presented in a different wrapper. This suggests the Pay.gov experience must clearly communicate amounts, attribution, and confirmation/receipt details.

## Recruitment 🎯	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 
- Veterans who have experience making payments towards VA benefit overpayment debt.
- We would like for Perigean to recruit a total of 15 Veterans who do not use assistive technology. We are aiming for 10 sessions total.  
- Per VA guidance, the team will conduct an additional round of usability testing for accessible technology (assistive device, etc.) users once we have a coded prototype.

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
- Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
- Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:
> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **1.5x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 10 ideal completed sessions, request 15 total participants)*

- `Veterans:` **[15]**
- `Caregivers:` **[0]**
- `Dependents:` **[0]**
- `Total:` **[15]**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **[10]**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?* 

- `Have a debt balance from overpayments in the last year`  
- `Are comfortable talking about their personal finances`
- `Be willing to share a web browser window on their device during the session`
- `Have a working microphone on their device`
- `Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen`

## Timeline 🗓️
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **2/20/26, 1-5pm ET**

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **Athena Bozak**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **Tuesday, February 24, 12-1:15pm ET** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **3/2/26-3/23/26**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **75 minutes**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **60 mins**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **2 per day**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
