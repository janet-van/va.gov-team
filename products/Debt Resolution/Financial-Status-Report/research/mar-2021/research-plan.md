# Background Context
background:
  problem_statement: "There are multiple resolution pathways a Veteran can select when resolving their benefit debt, including: requesting an extended payment plan, submitting a compromise offer, or asking for a waiver. All of these options require the submission of a Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655), which captures a monthly snapshot of the Veteran's household income and expenses. Our goal is to test the FSR's MVP with Veterans to uncover pain points and areas of improvement."

Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Financial Status Report (FSR), March 2021
----- 

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team. (This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.)

## Goals

**1\. What product & team are you doing this research for?**

This research consists of a usability test on the digitized VA Form 5655, or Financial Status Report (FSR), led by the Debt Resolution team.

**2\. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**

There are multiple resolution pathways a Veteran can select when resolving their benefit debt, including: requesting an extended payment plan, submitting a compromise offer, or asking for a waiver. All of these options require the submission of a Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655), which captures a monthly snapshot of the Veteran's household income and expenses. Our goal is to test the FSR's MVP with Veterans to uncover pain points and areas of improvement. 

**3\. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?**

**Introduction page:**

* Do Veterans understand the purpose of filling out the form (The "so what" or "how does this help me?" factor?)
* Do Veterans understand the available repayment options?
* Do Veterans read the subway map steps to learn about what information they'll need to submit the form, or do they skip over that information?
  * If Veterans read the subway map steps, what do they think about needing to require all that information?

**Form:**

* Are Veterans able to easily complete each section of the form?
* Would Veterans be able to easily provide their spouse's employment and income information?
* Is it clear to Veterans why they need to provide their financial information?
* Do Veterans understand each resolution option and the impact each one has on the form's processing order?
* What do Veterans expect to do if they need to submit the form with revisions?
* Are Veterans able to easily use the new list loop component? 

**After submission:**

* What do Veterans expect to do after they've submitted their request? (Print?)
* What communications do Veterans expect to receive about their request?

**4\. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?**

* Veterans will be able to identify and select which debt(s) they want to request financial help for, but they may struggle to select a resolution option
* Veterans might not know their spouse's employment history or complete monthly financial snapshot 
* Veterans may feel overwhelmed when they begin inputting household expenses and assets, but may find the task easier when they see the predetermined list of input types
* Veterans may be concerned about supplying information for assets such as vehicles 
* Veterans may want to print a copy of their submitted application for their records
* Veterans will likely not know all their financial information, such as payroll deductions, without needing to search their personal records
* Veterans may be interested in next steps following their application submission and when they can expect a decision from DMC
* Veterans may be interested in updating their submitted FSR if their financial situation changes or they forgot to include an asset

## Method

**1\. What method of research are you planning?**

Remote moderated qualitative interviews and task-based usability testing using staging. The "unauthenticated" flow has been hard-coded to include mock PII so that we can test without staging credentials.

**2\. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**

We're using moderated qualitative interviews to understand our user's thoughts and experiences navigating VA-related debts. Much of the form's functionality (particularly list loop and type-ahead functionality) is prohibitively difficult to test using a prototype, so we have decided to test in staging. We want to determine whether or not the form's flow is intuitive and uncover areas of improvement. Additionally, testing in staging will allow us to expand our recruitment criteria to include participants that use assistive technology.

**3\. Where are you planning to do your research? If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)**

Online Zoom meetings

**4\. What will you be testing? (Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)**

Unauthenticated form in staging

**5\. If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)**

Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment

**1\. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

Primary criteria

This criteria is necessary to conduct the study. 

* We would like a total of 15 participants to be scheduled (for a minimum of 8 successfully completed sessions)
* We would like 7-8 participants who have previously been notified about a VA-related debt
* While the FSR asks for financial information, we won't be asking our participants to provide exact financial information. However, we want to simulate a real experience as much as we can to ensure  the experience is intuitive for Veterans 
  * Please confirm participants  are comfortable providing an estimate of financial figures such as their monthly household income and expenses
* Please confirm participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screen share
* For this session, we are able to include those who use assistive technology, such as screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and ChromeVox).
* For this session, we are able to include people with significant vision loss.
* For this session, we are able to include people who use magnification tools.

**Secondary criteria**

This criteria contains nice-to-haves that creates a diverse participant pool. 

* At least 1 woman
* At least 1 person of color
* At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
* At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
* At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
* At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
* At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
* At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
* At least one participant that has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.
* At least one non-native English speaker
* At least one person who uses assistive technology (AT), such as specialized keyboards, switches, and/or hearing aids

## When?

**1\. Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?**

March 19-24

**2\. Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?**

We're testing in staging: [https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-5655/](https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-5655/)

The pathway we're following will take them through a mocked authenticated flow by clicking "Start your application without signing in" so that we will not have people signing in.

**3\. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?** 

About 1 hour

Please schedule 30 min buffer between sessions

**4\. Availability:** If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.

* March 19: 9:30am - 5:00pm EST
* March 22: 9:30am - 5:00pm EST
* March 23: 9:30am - 5:00pm EST
* March 24: 9:30am - 5:00pm EST

Please allow at least 30 minutes between sessions

**5\. Pilot:** Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?

March 16: 11:00am EST with Riley Orr (riley@amida.com), Rebecca Walsh (rebecca.walsh@adhocteam.us), and Craig Wheeler (cwheeler@governmentcio.com)
