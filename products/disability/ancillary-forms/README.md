**Super Epic:** [Connected Forms - Help users understand the relationship between the disability application and its many supporting forms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/114934)

✅ [Discovery Milestone 1 - Refining the super epic problem statement, goals, and setting initial hypotheses](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/135710)

✅ [Discovery Milestone 2 - Review hypotheses for roadmap & plan next steps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/137288#issuecomment-4195639614)



## Hypothesis
We believe that veterans lack a clear mental model of the 526 as a potentially multi-form submission, which leads to abandonment at the ancillary form entry point, poor data quality, and post-submission confusion, as evidenced by page-level abandonment rates, qualitative friction findings in the evidence, and nested form flow and call center contact patterns.

## Objective
Establish clear, consistent visibility of the relationship between the 21-526EZ and its ancillary forms at every critical touchpoint, from the landing page through post-submission confirmation, so that veterans can make informed decisions, submit complete and accurate information, and understand what they signed.

## Goals
- Reduce abandonment at ancillary form triggers.
- Reduce preventable support contact related to form confusion and post-submission questions.
- Increase veteran confidence and trust through the submission experience.


## Scope
- 21-526EZ landing page: setting expectation for potential multi-form scope.
- Ancillary form entry points within form, in flow moments where ancillary forms are triggered.
- Review and submit page list forms that will be submitted.
- Confirmation page and follow-up emails; plain-language summary of what was submitted and which forms failed.
- Research synthesis mapping existing abandonment, qualitative and call center data to specific flow touch points

Who we've talked with

Public Websites & Facilities (PW&F) team:
- Juliana Jara / Marcia Volpe (C&IA 🎉)
- Tim Shundo (tim.shundo@civicactions.com)
- Tina Kambil (tina.kambil@agile6.com)
- Dave Pickett (dave.pickett@civicactions.com)

We learned from Shannon Ford that the intro page is an outdated pattern. 

PW&F is focused on the unauthenticated pages
DBC is focused on the disability claims forms and pages

While the public websites team is just upstream of our authenticated experience, they are re-architecting it to help users find forms more easily. (The VA has some fifteen hundred forms currently.) In our talks, we’ve covered how Veterans can access primary forms like the 10-10EZ and 526EZ by navigating to benefits, searching or using the Forms finder.

Whether the veteran navigates the disability benefits menu or uses the global search/forms finder, both paths lead to the Form 21-526EZ Info page.

### Design opportunities
- Side nav research identified header recommendations to improve navigation forward and back through the form. This aligns with a sub-structure pattern that can be explored to bring transparency to the page structure that the Veteran is navigating. Figma Team 5 [526EZ Side Nav adds visibility using an eyebrow label](https://www.figma.com/design/pvrA4dBGYhgiRyI0cxN8vE/526---Side-Navigation?node-id=6186-10752&t=a2E2ypXCT3CBbDtK-11)

- Related to Headers, another opportunity was raised in the 0781 staging review bug log.

3. Review and Submit page enumerates the ancillary forms (R&S of 21-526EZ flow)</summary>
 
**Connected Forms:** Review and Submit page enumerates the ancillary forms (R&S of 21-526EZ flow) (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/135720)
To support the user's comprehension and successful submission, set the expectation that multiple forms are available within the 21-526EZ flow.

### Pain Point
The Review and Submit page does not enumerate all submitted forms. Veterans are signing documents without a clear understanding of what those documents are. This creates a gap with direct downstream consequences.

## Design Opportunities
- Explore how users might understand what forms were submitted
- Explore how users are able to print out all the associated forms from the submission page prior to sending the data to downstream services

Connected Forms: Reduce post-submission confusion of ancillary forms within the 21-526EZ flow (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/135721)

### Pain point
- Post-submission — confirmation page and emails do not clarify which forms were submitted or which failed.

### Inherited from KPI Metrics

| Inherited Form | Downloads (9/1/2021–9/1/2022, Find a Form) | Mail Submissions (Prior Year, Central Mail) |
|---|---|---|
| VA Form 21-4138 | — | — |
| VA Form 21-10210 | 47,074 | 28,877 |
| VA Form 21-0972 | 11,133 | — |
| VA Form 21-0966 | 220,463 | 407,570 |
| VA Form 26-4555 | 23,180 | 6,122 |

Comparison to 2025 paper submissions

| Paper 526EZ submissions that include inherited forms | Paper submission | Count |
|---|---|---:|
| **VA Form 21-4138** | Multiple combos (with exams, DD214, med records, correspondence, etc.) | **106,074** |
| **VA Form 21-10210** | Combo with `VA Form 21-10210, Lay Witness Statement` | **67** |
| **VA Form 21-0972** | **Not present**  | **0** |
| **VA Form 21-0966** | Combo with `21-0966; 21-526EZ` and/or `21-0966; 21-526EZ; 20-0995` | **518** |
| **VA Form 26-4555** | **Not present**  | **0** |



**Design opportunities**
- What pattern can notifications and confirmation pages show to help veterans clearly understand what they have submitted
- Metrics baseline: ~97% submission success rate, ~25–30% download/print interaction on confirmation, with duplicate submissions and abandonment rates tracked at the page level.
