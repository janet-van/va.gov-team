# Research Design
methodology: "Remote moderated usability testing with clickable medium-fidelity Figma prototype"
research_format:
  location: remote
  moderated: true

# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand users' expectations for homescreen content and navigation"
  - goal_2: "Understand how users interpret and use new design concept's homescreen content and capabilities"
  - goal_3: "Understand any points of confusion for users on the homescreen content and navigation, including for users with cognitive disabilities"
research_questions:
  - "What content do users expect to find on the homescreen?"
  - "Where do users expect to find their Veteran status card, disability rating and payments, and dependents verification?"
  - "Do users expect due dates for some or all 'Action required' items?"
  - "What level of detail do users need for homescreen content so that they can take action and complete tasks?"
  - "Do users notice, understand, and take action on items in 'Action required' and 'Activity' sections?"
  - "When tasks are surfaced on the homescreen, how do users want and expect to complete them?"
  - "When provided with the opportunity to complete tasks such as paying copay and refilling prescription without leaving the homescreen, do users understand what to do and choose to do that instead of navigating away?"
  - "What causes users confusion or misunderstandings?"
  - "Are there any terms or processes that cause particular confusion for users with cognitive disabilities?"

hypotheses:
  - "Users will expect to find new content such as new Secure messages and items requiring their review and action on the homescreen."
  - "Users very familiar with the app will expect to find Veteran status card and disability rating and payments on the homescreen as reflects the current live app layout."
  - "Users less familiar with the app will expect to find Veteran status card and dependents verification in Profile."
  - "Users less familiar with the app will expect to find disability payments and rating in Profile or in Payments."
  - "Users will sometimes want more information than is presented on homescreen to help them with some tasks such as managing prescriptions, due dates for Action required items, or for appointments prep."
  - "Users will notice and give more weight to 'Action required' items because of the label and design styling of the section."
  - "Users will be able to describe in their own words what the 'Action required' section is for."
  - "Users will want to take action on both 'Action required' items and 'Activity' items that usually are of top concern to Veterans such as new appointment information, prescription updates, travel pay."
  - "Users may not be able to articulate exactly what kind of items belong in the 'Activity' section."
  - "Users will want to complete tasks as directly as possible."
  - "Users will expect to be able to complete tasks directly from the homescreen when there is a call to action button associated with the item such as 'Pay copay' for a medical copayment."
  - "Since homescreen content uses plain language and short, to-the-point phrases, users will generally understand terms and calls to action."
  - "Users may experience minor confusion due to lack of familiarity with specific items such as 'evidence request.'"
expected_outcomes: "We plan to incorporate insights to guide design decisions for homescreen and related actions so that we evolve current design concepts based on Veterans' needs and expectations. Insights will impact design refinements and influence future feature prioritization for homescreen functionality. We will base homescreen updates on mental model alignment for where users expect to find featues and how users expect to interact with homescreen content. We will work with ADE on ptoential addtional research as designs become more developed."

**Key Takeaways from Previous Research:**
1. Personalized Home Screen Evaluative Research:
- `When asked to imagine how they might use the homescreen of the app to help them with something in their life, participants described using the home screen as the entry point to: 1. give them access to a specific task, be reminded of an outstanding task, use the information on the home screen itself to accomplish a task.`
- `5 of 13 participants found it useful to see disability rating and monthly compensation displayed together, and 1 said it was specifically helpful to see it on the home screen`
- `Nearly all participants expected to tap and then used the home screen modules successfully to begin their tasks (and arrived where they predicted they would be). In the case of one task (prescriptions), most participants’ expectations of the module destination was different from what they experienced when using the app. (They didn't expect to see the full list of prescriptions.)`
- `6 of the 8 participants that saw Proof of Veteran status on homescreen commented on its usefulness`

2. Information Architecture & Navigation Evaluative Research:

- `All participants directly or indirectly found their Disability Rating and Disability Payments though they had moved to Benefits and Payments respectively from their original location in Profile.`
- `Recommendation: Investigate moving Manage dependents into the Profile section in the future`

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

> [!NOTE]
> Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

### Goals

`1.` **Understand users' expectations for homescreen content and navigation**

`2.` **Understand how users interpret and use new design concept's homescreen content and capabilities**

`3.` **Understand any points of confusion for users on the homescreen content and navigation, including for users with cognitive disabilities**

  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**We plan to incorporate insights to guide design decisions for homescreen and related actions so that we evolve current design concepts based on Veterans' needs and expectations. Insights will impact amount and type of information displayed on homescreen, the organization of homescreen sections, and functionality including direct action from the homescreen on simple tasks versus going to the category screen. We will base homescreen updates on mental model alignment for where users expect to find features and how users expect to interact with homescreen content. We will work with ADE on potential additional research as designs become more developed.** 

---

### Research questions
> [!NOTE]
> Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the` [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)

***Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:***
	
`What will I do with what I learn from this question?`
  
`Does this question serve the goals of my study?`

**Research goal 1: Understand users' expectations for homescreen content and navigation**
1. What content do users expect to find on the homescreen?
2. Where do users expect to find their Veteran status card, disability rating and payments, and dependents verification?
3. Do users expect due dates for some or all "Action required" items?
4. What level of detail do users need for homescreen content so that they can take action and complete tasks?

**Research goal 2: Understand how users interpret and use new design concept's homescreen content and capabilities**

1. Do users notice, understand, and take action on items in "Action required" and "Activity" sections?
2. When tasks are surfaced on the homescreen, how do users want and expect to complete them?
3. When provided with the opportunity to complete tasks such as paying copay and refilling prescription without leaving the homescreen, do users understand what to do and choose to do that instead of navigating to the feature?

**Research goal 3: Understand any points of confusion for users on the homescreen content and navigation, including for users with cognitive disabilities**

1. What causes users confusion or misunderstandings?
2. Are there any terms or processes that cause particular confusion for users with cognitive disabilities?

> [!TIP]
>Enter more questions as needed

### Hypotheses
> [!NOTE]
> Remember to constrain the hypotheses to the goals of your study!
 
**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

---
**Research goal 1: Understand users' expectations for homescreen content and navigation**
1. Users will expect to find new content such as new Secure messages and items requiring their review and action on the homescreen.
2. Users very familiar with the app will expect to find Veteran status card and disability rating and payments on the homescreen as reflects the current live app layout.
3. Users less familiar with the app will expect to find Veteran status card and dependents verification in Profile.
4. Users less familiar with the app will expect to find disability payments and rating in Profile or in Payments.
5. Users will sometimes want more information than is presented on homescreen to help them with some tasks such as managing prescriptions, due dates for Action required items, or for appointments preparation. 

**Research goal 2: Understand how users interpret and use homescreen content and capabilities**

1. Users will notice and give more weight to "Action required" items because of the label and design styling of the section.
2. Users will be able to describe in their own words what the "Action required" section is for. 
3. Users will want to take action on both "Action required" items and "Activity" items that usually are of top concern to Veterans such as new appointment information, prescription updates, travel pay claims.
4. Users may not be able to articulate exactly what kind of items belong in the "Activity" section.
5. Users will want to complete tasks as directly as possible.
6. Users will expect to be able to complete tasks directly from the homescreen when there is a call to action button associated with the item such as "Pay copay" for a medical copayment. 

**Research goal 3: Understand how users interpret and use homescreen content and capabilities**
1. Since homescreen content uses plain language and short, to-the-point phrases, users will generally understand terms and calls action.
2. Users may experience minor confusion due to lack of familiarity with specific items such as 'evidence request.'

## Methodology  🛠️
***Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.*** 

<details><summary>Examples of common research methods include</summary> 
	
- `Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research`
- `Contextual inquiry - appropriate for generative research`
- `Card sorts - appropriate for generative and evaluative research; depending on the study design` 
- `Tree tests - appropriate for evaluative research`
- `Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research`
- `User acceptance testing (UAT) - required before product release`

</details>

This research will be a remote moderated study using Zoom. Participants will be asked to narrate their thoughts as they navigate the clickable, medium-fidelity Figma prototype of the proposed homescreen redesign. Participants will then be asked for targeted feedback on where to find items moved off the homescreen with the redesign, and to try to complete the tasks of paying a copay and refilling a prescription directly from the homescreen through a newly designed user flow concept. Since Figma prototypes cannot be used with screen readers, we will prioritize recruiting at least 5 participants with cognitive disabilities and assess accessibility of content and navigation from their point of view. The conversation guide is written to be plain language and to allot ample time for each task to account for participants with cognitive disabilities who may need additional time to review and respond to designs.

## Recruitment 🎯	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 
- Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
- Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and download the [recruitment checker (Excel)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/digital-experience/accessibility/research/RecruitmentCheckerSpreadsheet.xlsx) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity and use it to plan your participant demographics for this study.

**We would like Perigean to recruit Veterans as participants using lean maximum variation. Target 14 to seat and complete 9 sessions total.**

### Recruitment criteria

- Must have interacted with the mobile app at least once

During the session:
- Are willing to share their screen.
- Have a working microphone on their device.


### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:
> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **1.5x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 10 ideal completed sessions, request 15 total participants)*


- `Veterans:` **[14]**
- `Caregivers:` **[0]**
- `Dependents:` **[0]**
- `Total:` **[14]**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **[9]**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?* 

**All participants must:**
- `Be on a mobile device (recruit mix of device types)`
- `During the session, be willing to share a web browser window on their device`
- `Have a working microphone`
- `Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen`
- `Have used the VA Health and Benefits app at least once in the last year`
- `Have a service-related disability rating of at least 10%`

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
