# CX App Pain Point Catalog

## When & How to Update This Catalog

### Ownership

**Mobile Platform** owns the CX Pain Point Library and is responsible for keeping this catalog current. The owner reviews incoming feedback, adds or updates pain points, and maintains the change log.

### Sources & When to Update

**Update this catalog when new user feedback is received** from any of these sources: App Store and Google Play reviews, in-app surveys, platform surveys, retros, direct user feedback, quarterly app review analyses, and monthly research reports.

**When to update:** After each quarterly app review analysis; when monthly reports reveal recurring themes not yet captured; when retros or direct feedback surface new or escalating issues; and when significant product changes (e.g., new features, integrations) may affect existing pain points.

### Ranking Factors

Use these factors to assess and rank each pain point when adding or updating entries. Each factor maps to a column in the pain point table below.

| Factor | Definition | Table Column |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Severity** | High = user cannot accomplish main task or would do it wrong; Medium = can accomplish but with confusion/workarounds/minor errors; Low = would be better UX if resolved | Severity |
| **Trending/Frequency** | First-time issue vs. found in multiple research reports/sources | Trending/Frequency |
| **Users Impacted** | Edge case, some users, majority of users | Users Impacted |
| **Legal/Risk Obligation** | e.g., accessibility issue, data privacy issue | Legal/Risk |

### Process for Adding to the Library

1. Add new pain points as rows in the table below. Assess each pain point against the ranking factors above and populate the corresponding columns.
2. Link evidence (e.g., quarterly analysis, monthly reports) in the Evidence column.
3. Document the catalog in the research folder of the GitHub repo. All pain point catalogs live in the Mobile Platform research documentation.
4. Add a change log entry for any substantive update (new pain point, status change, or significant edit).

### Pain Point Lifecycle (Status)

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| *(blank)* | Not yet triaged or no mitigation in progress |
| Planning research | Research or discovery planned to inform mitigation |
| In progress | Mitigation actively being built or implemented |
| Partially resolved | Some mitigation deployed; may need further work |
| Resolved | Pain point addressed; user feedback no longer reports the issue. Remove from active table or move to an "Archived/Resolved" section and add change log entry |

**How a pain point gets marked as resolved:** The owner confirms that the mitigation has been deployed and that feedback sources (app reviews, surveys, etc.) no longer report the issue. Update the Status column to "Resolved," add a change log entry, and either archive the row or move it to a resolved section.

## Pain Points

| Rank | Pain Point | Severity | Trending/Frequency | Users Impacted | Legal/Risk | Evidence | Key Mitigation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | As a Veteran, I want to login quickly and reliably to the mobile app, but I am blocked by issues such as sign-in looping and authentication problems | High | Frequently reported by large number of users with negative feedback | All users | Potential disparity for Android users — higher instance of login issues reported in feedback despite there being more iOS app users could be construed as discriminatory. There is a higher rate of Android users leaving feedback overall which likely accounts for this. | 1.

[Mobile App February 2026 Feedback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/Monthly%20User%20Research/2026/February-2026-User-Research.md) | | Requires further investigation (engineering/data analytics) to identify root causes of latency and authentication failures; likely multiple mitigations needed | |
| 2 | As a Veteran, I want to have detailed information about my appointments so I can adequately prepare for them, but I am blocked by not having enough appointment details such as provider name or the issue I am scheduled to be seen for. | Medium | Recurring report in multiple research reports; less than sign-in issues | Majority of users (not all app users have appointments) | None | 1. [Mobile App Q3 Analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/Quarterly%20User%20Research%20/Q3/Mobile%20App%20Q3%20Analysis.pdf) 2.

| 3 | As a Veteran who has medical travel I want reimbursement for, I want to easily find and submit travel pay in the app for all my eligible appointments, but I am blocked by it being difficult to find the travel pay area in the app. | Medium | Moderate negative feedback, less than sign-in issues | Subset of users (those with mileage eligible for reimbursement) | None (workaround exists via website) | [Mobile App Q3 Analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/Quarterly%20User%20Research%20/Q3/Mobile%20App%20Q3%20Analysis.pdf) | Highlight travel pay on the home screen; conduct research with Veteran users to identify the most logical placement for travel pay | Planning research | 
| 4 | As a Veteran who has medical appointments, I want to manage all appointment based tasks directly in the app, but am blocked by my inability to book, cancel, or reschedule appointments in the app. | Medium | Recurring in multiple monthly reports | Majority of users (those with VA medical appointments; exact % TBD) | None (available on website) | 1. [Mobile App Q3 Analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/Quarterly%20User%20Research%20/Q3/Mobile%20App%20Q3%20Analysis.pdf) 2.

| 5 | As a Veteran, I want to delete old secure messages so I can focus on new and relevant messages, but I am blocked by the app not providing me the ability to delete. | Low | Multiple monthly reports | Majority of users (not all app users use secure messaging) | None | 1.

| 6 | As a Veteran, I want to access my VA letters and documents (claims decision letters, payment history, disability letters) in the app, but I am blocked by letters being missing, payment history only loading for certain years, and incorrect dates on printed letters. | Medium | Emerging in Q4; ~15+ mentions across Oct–Dec 2025 | Subset of users (those who need letters/documents) | None (workaround exists via website) | 1.

| 8 | As a Veteran, I want to clearly understand my prescription status (shipped, pending, available for refill), but I am blocked by confusing refill lists, unclear status labels, outdated pharmacy information, and lack of medication descriptions or prescribing doctor information. | Medium | Reported in Q4; prescriptions remain highest-rated feature but status clarity is a gap | Subset of users (those who refill prescriptions) | None | [Q4 App Review Analysis](Q4-App-Review-Analysis.md) | Enhance refill status visibility with clearer labels; add prescribing doctor and medication description where available; consider removing cancelled/expired medications from refill list | New — Q4 2025 |
| 9 | As a Veteran, I want the app to work reliably after updates, but I am blocked by the app no longer working properly after updates, including crashes and extended loading times. | Medium | Small but impactful subset of Q4 reviews, February 2026 reviews | Edge case / some users | None | 1.
