# 530EZ Transition Hub

**Updated March 2026**

> The purpose of this transition document is to outline the current state of 530EZ forms' product development. It serves as a "front door" to documentation and resources collected during the course of product design and development from August 2024 through March 2026. Included are links to more specific transition hubs where you can find direct links to resources and references used during design and development. These transition docs are "point in time" documents, and may not reflect current progress, deployments or upcoming efforts.

## Product context 

- The online **530EZ** form allows Veterans to fill out and submit the application for Veterans burial allowance and transportaion benefits. The burial allowance can help pay for a Veteran’s funeral services, burial, and transportation costs.  The applicant may be eligible for Veterans burial allowances if they are paying for the burial and funeral costs and won’t be reimbursed by any other organization, like another government agency or the Veteran’s employer.

### Product Goal

Make the online Burial experience as easy to complete and cohesive as possible, while ensuring that applicants provide sufficient supporting documentation to ensure that submissions are reliable and processed as quickly as possible.

## Roadmap

### Done (recently)

- **Paper form alignment** enhancements based on the latest form provided by VBA in December 2025. These changes have been implemented on Staging but have not been released to production yet. [See tickets related to the milestone here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/1588)
  - We conducted several audits of the burial form to identify changes that impact the digital form and clarified requirements with VBA. [[Sharepoint] Paper form audit](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/vaabdvro/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B7A4350FD-856D-438E-9096-30C6A7B5E8D4%7D&file=Burial_%20Audit%20VA%20Form%20Updates.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)
  - Designs for this version of the paper form are under the "✏️ Design Enhancements" section in the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/jpJQSCKiGegacdW4RH5uQB/21P-530EZ---Burial-Benefits?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=Brz8g1LRPQ1gKdV8-0).
- **Minimal header update** - The Minimal header is the latest standard header for usage in forms. The goal is to help the user focus on the task at hand. Released 3/12/26.
- **Plain language updates** based on the February 2025 desk research, applied throughout the form and its resource page with C/IA.
  - [[INTAKE] PBB: Burial allowance form content updates #130650](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/130650)
  - [[INTAKE] Pension and burial benefits: Burial allowance content updates #123182](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/123182)
  - **[LOA3 Authentication for 530](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/milestone/16662)** - 530EZ now requires authentication for all users. Released December 2025.

 ### Next

- [BPDS integration for 530](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/121603)- Simplifies backend processing. POI (Pension Optimization Initiative) automation process would be able to more efficiently automate processing of 530 applications and veterans would receive their benefits faster. Status as of 3/27/26: Test transactions provided to VBA/BPDS team. Per 3/19 comment from Eric Henne of VBA, pausing to focus on SPA.
