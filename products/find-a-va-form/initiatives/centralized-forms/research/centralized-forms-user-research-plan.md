# Research Plan for Public Websites, Centralized Forms, March 2026

## Background 🏗️
Forms are a necessary part of managing healthcare and benefits for veterans and their families. UX Research to date suggests that users who know which form they need can usually find it, but often struggle to identify the right actions, navigate between different parts of the site, and interpret form-related information. Content redundancy and inconsistent navigation (e.g., between Benefit Hubs and the Forms area) cause cognitive load and increase time on task. A significant pain point is also the handoff when users must download, complete, and upload forms.

The Centralized Forms initiative aims to address these issues by:
- Centralizing all digitized forms and form-related tasks (URL updates)
- Streamlining site navigation and reducing duplication (e.g., merging "How to Apply" content into the Form Detail page)

This deduplication of information and simplified navigation should have the following outcomes:
- **For Veterans and 3rd Parties:**
  - Increased findability of specific forms
  - Improved search results (SEO optimization)
  - Increased discoverability of form-related information and how to submit the form
  - Increased understanding of form-related content and preparation information
- **For VA Staff**
  - Decreased content maintenance time of duplicative form related information
  - Decreased maintenance of referring links
  - Decreased IA design time
    
This research plan focuses on evaluating the new centralized experience rather than comparing several divergent prototypes, but it is still essential to probe user mental models, navigation expectations, and informational needs.

**Key Takeaways from Previous Research:**
- `Navigation challenges are present to find all needed information and moving between auth and unauth content. Inconsistent language and visuals for wayfinding.`
- `Missing clear, up-front call to action sometimes buried in information; reduce cognitive load with clear actions and progressive disclosure for detail.`
- `Difficulty in quickly and clearly identifying criteria and required documents/related forms.`

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Assess Findability & Navigation: Determine whether users can successfully locate forms and critical information.**

`2.` **Evaluate Comprehension & Timing of Information on the Form Detail page: Assess if users understand form eligibility, associated tasks, what is needed to complete pre/post form submission, and the intended audience for each form at the right moments in their journey.**
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**This research will help optimize the design of the Form Detail page. It will identify user requirements for form centralization (e.g. navigational elements/interaction patterns, relationship between different components of form information such as eligibility, supporting documentation, next steps, other forms and application CTA’s) and enable a comprehensive design iteration.

In order to proceed, we would like to see the following: 
- ≥80% participants can confirm if a form applies to them within 2 interactions.
- ≥75% can correctly identify and initiate their preferred submission option (online/PDF/help) within 2 interactions.
- Confidence to start the form ≥4/5 for ≥70% of participants.
** 

---

### Research questions

**`1.`Can users identify and access the form they need in the new centralized flow?**
Sub-questions: 
- 1A. How do users conceptualize the navigation and relationship between forms, benefits, and site sections (task, benefit, forms library, etc.)?
- 1B. Are users confused by the transition between benefit hubs and centralized forms?
- 1C. What navigational elements help or confuse users (breadcrumbs, links, headers, TOC, CTAs)?
**

**`2.`Is information presented in the new centralized/Form Detail page at the right step, in the right detail?** Sub-questions: 
- 2A. Where do users expect to find “what do I need”, “am I eligible”, “how to submit”, and “what happens next” content? In what order?
- 2B. Does combining Form Detail "About" and "How to Apply" content enable users to more easily find the information they need to be prepared to complete their form?
- 2C. Are the different options for form submission clear, understandable and easy to identify?
**

**`3.`What risks, if any, are there of combining the Form Detail and How to Apply pages for Veterans and their families?** 
- 3A. Special Cases & Edge Scenarios: Identify any confusion around forms that are combined (serve multiple benefits/audiences).**

**`4.`Does the new Form Detail Page template overall work for both simple and complex forms (minimal/maximal?)**

### Hypotheses
---

**1. Centralizing forms will reduce user frustration and confusion with duplicate information. Users will prefer to have a single page with this information.** 

**2. Appropriately scoped detail on the Form Detail page will help Veterans & their families have more confidence (>4/5) that they are prepared to fill out and submit forms regardless of where they navigated from.** 

**3. Standardizing CTAs (online form, download, find eligibility information) with key instructions will improve findability and streamline critical actions so that users can:**
- Identify whether it is the right form for them
- Understand available submission options
- Identify what is needed to submit and prepare before starting form
- Identify related or supporting forms
- Identify options for getting help with the form

**4. The PDF download process is clear and easy to use with sufficient detail.**
