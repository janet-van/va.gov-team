# Evaluation of Adding MIRECC FINVET "Meet Your Basic Needs" Resource to Discover Your Benefits

## Summary

After reviewing evidence from DYB studies, cross-product VA.gov research, and the FINVET resource itself, I recommend **Not Right Now** for adding a direct link to the MIRECC FINVET "Meet Your Basic Needs" page to DYB.

The research evidence strongly supports the need for crisis and basic-needs resources in DYB. Our Feb 2026 study recommends adding it. Cross-product research review consistently shows that Veterans in transition face compounding stressors (financial, housing, family, social adjustment) and need accessible crisis pathways beyond the help with suicidality and mental health crisis offered by the Veteran Crisis Line.

However, the FINVET resource itself has significant usability problems: Confusing navigation, legacy visual design that doesn't match VADS or VA.gov standards, and a structure that may increase cognitive load for Veterans already in distress. Linking Veterans in crisis to a poorly usable resource risks eroding the trust DYB has established. Instead, we should pursue a broader crisis resource strategy supported by our and other teams' research, and consider FINVET's content categories as a model for including help with basic needs.

## Pros and Cons of Adding

### Pros

* Strong research evidence that Veterans want and need basic-needs and crisis resources in DYB  
* Partially fills the gap identified in our Feb 2026 research findings: "We need to conduct specific testing with users experiencing cognitive or high-stress loads to evaluate the implementation of crisis/unhoused resources on the discovery page"  
* FINVET covers categories such as food, housing, financial assistance, clothing, and transportation, which are unmet needs that extend beyond what the Veterans Crisis Line offers.  
* Would be a low-effort addition of a single benefit card  
* The content scope of FINVET aligns with what P5 from our February study, and other participants who have raised crisis support as a missing resource described as a missing area of support, which is resources that not only address suicidality, but also housing and financial crises.  
* FINVET is new within the VA.gov digital ecosystem. No other product references it or provides overlapping services.

### Cons

* Poor usability. [Meet Your Basic Needs](https://www.mirecc.va.gov/visn19/finvet/meet-your-basic-needs.asp) page has confusing navigation, legacy design that does not match VA.gov standards, and an interface that may increase cognitive load rather than reduce it. See appendix for heuristic UX evaluation summary.   
* Risk of eroding trust. Linking to a confusing external resource could undermine the tool's credibility, especially for Veterans in distress who need simple, clear pathways to getting help.  
* Not responsive or mobile-optimized. 61% of crisis-related interactions on VA.gov happen on mobile (according to Veteran Crisis Line analytics). Legacy pages are unlikely to meet mobile usability expectations and may cause harm by adding friction to an already difficult process.  
* Scope mismatch. FINVET is a VISN 19 resource. While most content is national, some content may be regionally specific or inconsistently maintained, and the regional labels add to the confusion for users, making it difficult to feel confident they are getting useful information.  
* FINVET is a resource list rather than a specific benefit. DYB is structured around benefits with eligibility criteria. A general resource page doesn't fit the current card structure cleanly.

## Resource Description

[**MIRECC FINVET: Meet Your Basic Needs**](https://www.mirecc.va.gov/visn19/finvet/meet-your-basic-needs.asp)

FINVET is a resource developed by the VA's Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC). The "Meet Your Basic Needs" page provides links and information for Veterans who need help with fundamental needs including:

* Food assistance  
* Housing and shelter  
* Clothing  
* Financial assistance  
* Transportation  
* Legal aid

**Target audience:** Veterans experiencing financial hardship, housing instability, food insecurity, or other basic-needs crises.

**Eligibility:** No specific eligibility requirements. These are general resources available to Veterans.

## Type of Change

**Additive**: Adding a new resource link, though this differs from existing benefit cards because FINVET is a resource hub rather than a specific VA benefit with eligibility criteria.

## Step 2: Evaluate

### Potential Benefits

**Who is it for?**

* Veterans and transitioning service members experiencing crisis situations including housing instability, food insecurity, financial hardship, or basic unmet needs.  
  * 35% of Veterans report trouble paying bills in their first years post-service (Combined VA Debt Portal research)  
  * 2,740+ enrolled Veterans are currently flagged as "homeless" in the VES system (Health Care Enrollment initiative brief)

**How would it benefit them?**

* Provides a single page with categorized basic-needs resources, which is a model that aligns with what research participants have requested, and with research from other product teams.  
* Addresses needs beyond what the Veterans Crisis Line offers, which is centered around suicide prevention and addressing mental health crisis.  
* Could serve as a low-barrier, anonymous entry point. Virtual Agent research shows Veterans experiencing economic insecurity prefer anonymous channels.

**How is it different from other benefits in that category?**

* DYB currently includes VA mental health services and disability compensation for mental health conditions, but does not include basic-needs resources.  
* The Veterans Crisis Line (in the VA.gov header) addresses acute mental health crisis but not the broader set of basic needs.  
* No existing DYB benefit card covers "I need help right now with food/housing/money".

### Potential Risks

**Usability risk (HIGH):**

* The FINVET page has confusing navigation and legacy design that does not align with VA.gov design standards  
* Veterans in crisis experience elevated cognitive load. Research shows system frustration itself can trigger or worsen crisis. ("When you're trying to bust through the frustration..." — P13, Harassment Study)

**Trust risk (MEDIUM):**

* DYB users rate the tool 4.3/5 for usability. All participants in the 2026 study report that they would recommend it.  
* Linking to a visually inconsistent, hard-to-navigate page may undermine that trust.  
* The .asp domain and legacy design may not feel like a trustworthy VA resource (research shows Veterans trust .gov/.mil domains).

**Maintenance risk (LOW-MEDIUM):**

* FINVET is maintained by VISN 19 MIRECC, not by the DYB team or [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) team. We have no control over content changes, link rot, or availability  
* If the page is taken down or restructured, the DYB link would break.

**Scope risk (LOW):**

* The resources offered align with other benefits in our product such as state Veterans benefits. The way they diverge from scope is that much like DYB, FINVET offers a list of resources.

### What Does the Research Say?

The need for crisis and basic-needs resources in DYB is well-established across multiple research streams:

**DYB's own research:**

* Feb 2026 Results Page 2.0 study explicitly recommends: *"We need to conduct specific testing with users experiencing cognitive or high-stress loads to evaluate the implementation of crisis/unhoused resources on the discovery page."*  
* V1 user testing (July 2024): "Mental health support would be useful as part of this tool"  
* P5 (Feb 2026\) provided a detailed design recommendation for categorized crisis resources including mental health, housing, and financial support — with a proposed "Are you a veteran in crisis? Click here" pattern

**Cross-product VA.gov research:**

* VCL analytics: 8,272 monthly sessions, 94% from header link, 50% result in engagement — demonstrates Veterans actively seek crisis support on VA.gov  
* Streamlined Waiver study: *"The fact that you are in crisis and need to talk I cannot say how often that needs to be repeated...you might be saving someone's life."* — P8  
* Harassment Reporting study: System frustration triggers crisis; Veterans need 24-hour access  
* Combined VA Debt Portal: 35% of Veterans struggle financially post-separation  
* Accredited Rep research: Reps manually prioritize homeless, terminally ill, and financially distressed Veterans  
* Virtual Agent research: Veterans with housing/food insecurity prefer anonymous digital channels  
* Health Care Enrollment: 2,740+ unhoused Veterans blocked by address-required forms

### Holistic Review

* FINVET's content categories (food, housing, financial aid, transportation) represent an unmet need in DYB  
* However, DYB is structured around benefit cards with eligibility criteria. A general resource page doesn't fit that pattern cleanly.  
* The Feb 2026 research finding calls for dedicated usability testing before implementing crisis resources. Adding FINVET without that testing would skip a step the research explicitly recommends.  
* Adding a single external link to a poorly usable legacy page is not a solution for the broader crisis-resource gap our research has identified

## Step 3: Stakeholder Consultation

### Who Do We Need to Talk To?

**VA Stakeholders:**

* Must talk to:  
  * Michael Deeb’s team  
  * If moving forward including this benefit, the VA.gov Platform/CAIA team to understand risks and standards for linking to legacy pages.  
* Should talk to:  
  * MIRECC VISN 19 team to understand FINVET's maintenance status, national applicability, and any planned updates  
  * Veterans Crisis Line team — to understand how FINVET relates to or complements VCL services

**Non-VA Stakeholders:**

* Might talk to:  
  * Department of Defense ESOB team

**Considerations:**

* If MIRECC has plans to modernize FINVET, timing the addition to coincide with a redesign could address the usability concerns  
* Understanding whether FINVET's content is nationally applicable or VISN 19-specific is critical before linking from a national tool

## Step 4: Decision and Recommendation

### Summary of Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

* Research strongly validates the need for basic-needs/crisis resources in DYB  
* FINVET covers the right content categories (food, housing, financial aid)  
* Low implementation effort  
* Would be novel and potentially high-impact for Veterans in crisis

**Cons:**

* FINVET's usability is poor — confusing navigation, legacy design, not mobile-optimized  
* Risk of eroding DYB's established trust and usability reputation  
* Doesn't fit DYB's benefit-card structure  
* No control over content accuracy or maintenance  
* Our own research recommends dedicated testing before implementing crisis resources  
* Regional scope may not serve all DYB users

### Recommendation

**Decision: Not Right Now**  
The research case for adding crisis and basic-needs resources to DYB is compelling and well-documented. However, FINVET's current usability does not meet the standard our users expect or that Veterans in crisis deserve. Linking to a confusing legacy page risks doing more harm than good for a distressed user.

**Recommended path forward:**

1. Pursue a broader crisis/basic-needs resource strategy rather than a single link. Use FINVET's content categories (food, housing, financial aid, transportation) as a model for what to include.  
   * Consider alternative destinations for each basic-needs category that have better usability (e.g., VA.gov housing assistance pages, 211.org, National Call Center for Homeless Veterans at 1-877-4AID-VET)  
   * Consider a DYB-native resource page bringing together these resources, or working with another team to create one.  
2. Conduct the dedicated usability testing that the Feb 2026 study recommended to test crisis resource implementations with users experiencing cognitive load or high stress while seeking benefits.  
3. Consult MIRECC VISN 19 to understand if FINVET modernization is planned, and revisit this evaluation if the UX changes for the better.

## Appendix: Summary of FINVET usability issues 

| Issue | Impact | Severity |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Three conflicting navigation paradigms create confusion | Veterans in distress may not be able to orient themselves or find their way back | Critical |
| Broken heading hierarchy (H1 → H3, skipping H2) | Screen reader users cannot navigate content structure reliably | Critical |
| Empty links with no text or alt text | Assistive technology encounters unlabeled interactive elements | Critical |
| "Not for emergency or crisis intervention" disclaimer prominent on a page about basic needs | Potentially discouraging for Veterans directed here when in crisis | Critical |
| No mobile-responsive design on a legacy .asp platform | Majority of crisis interactions are mobile; page likely unusable on phone | Critical |
| Visual design completely inconsistent with VA.gov | Jarring context switch from DYB erodes trust. The page may appear abandoned or unofficial. | High |
| No way to navigate between basic-needs subcategories without returning to parent page | Increases clicks and cognitive load for someone exploring multiple resource categories | High |
| "Find your path to financial success" tagline on a crisis-adjacent page | Tone mismatch. A Veteran seeking food or shelter is not on a "financial success journey" | High |
| Generic "Learn more" link text repeated | Non-descriptive for screen reader users | Medium |
| 6-level breadcrumb through clinical research hierarchy | Signals "research project" rather than "Veteran resource" | Medium |
| Triple legal disclaimer adds page weight | Contributes to poor signal-to-noise ratio | Low |
