#### 05/04/2025 Make header content more specific and actionable
- Feedback provided during Design intent.
- Original designs followed mobile, but it was determined that since we have more real estate we can provide more context to our users.

### Forms and applications
#### 03/20/2026 Two alerts in ACTION NEEDED card is okay
- Met with VADS team and confirmed that including two alerts in the ACTION NEEDED card is ok because:
   - Alerts in close proximity are allowed in some use cases.
   - The second alert only appears after a user action and is a small segment of users.

#### 03/13/2026 ACTION NEEDED having the PDF link
- Identified that the current PDF link on the ACTION NEEDED status does not work. Additional work would be needed to make the link functional.
- PO confirmed that having the PDF generate on ACTION NEEDED is not mission critical. If it's a low lift fix, continue with fix, if it's high lift, add to backlog.
- Verbal confirmation in team meeting.

#### 07/08/2025 Naming convention for form and application cards for cards that are not in SiP

## Shared projects
### Email verification

#### 11/06/2025 Alignment post midpoint review
- Met with governance team on 11/6 to discuss email verification alerts
- Decided to move forward with informational modal when the user selects "Resend confirmation link" button. This is due to technology constraints so the on page alert can change real time to reflect if the email bounced or was non deliverable at the same time of the send.
- Slim vs standard alert. In profile we typically use standard alerts for page level communications and slim alerts for card level communications. So the slim alert will show only inline with the Contact email card, and the standard alerts will show at page level on My VA and Notification settings. Aligned during this call that using the slim alert inline with Contact email card is ok due to all context being within the alert itself.
