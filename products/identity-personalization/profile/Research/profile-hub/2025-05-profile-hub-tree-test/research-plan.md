# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience Team, VA.gov Profile: Profile Hub, 05/2025

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

The Core Veteran Experience Crew ensures Veterans and beneficiaries have a cohesive logged-in experience across and within the current mobile and web modalities. The crew seeks to do this by developing and curating a personalized view of the Veteran’s and beneficiary’s information so they can easily understand their benefits and take action to manage and update their account and benefits. We aim to aggregate and elevate personalized tasks and information relevant to Veterans on VA.gov and the Flagship Health & Benefits Mobile app so Veterans and beneficiaries can quickly get a snapshot of their existing business with VA.

`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**Authenticated Experience**
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

We are iterating on the information architecture of the VA.gov Profile Hub based on previous user feedback and analytics in order to incorporate new features, including the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record, Individual Exposure Summary (ILER IES) report. The ILER IES report will be a downloadable PDF that informs Veterans of their toxic exposure information to inform their disability claims and health care treatments. [Implementation is being informed by prior research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2025-03-profile-secondary-research/research-findings.md#military-information)

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` Validate if incorporating the ILER IES report into a new Letters and documents section in VA.gov Profile matches Veterans mental models.

`2.` Validate if updating VA.gov Profile Hub to reflect recommendations from prior research and analytics match Veteran mental models.
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**Outcome will be a validated IA for incorporating new sections into VA.gov Profile Hub, including a Letters and documents section to house the downloadable ILER IES report.** 

---

### Research questions

`1.` Do Veterans associate the ILER IES report with Letters and documents?

`2.` Do recommendations to VA.gov Profile Hub, based on prior research and analytics, match Veterans mental models?

### Hypotheses

---

**`1.` Based on prior research, we believe Veterans will associate the ILER IES report with a Letters and documents section.**

**`2.` Based on prior research and analytics, we believe Veterans will want to manage all their letters and documents in a single section in VA.gov Profile.** 

**`3.` Based on prior research, we believe Veterans will want all of their contacts in a single section in VA.gov Profile.** 

*Note: We acknowledge the limitations of this study, in that informed recommendations are based on multiple studies. For that purpose we added in additional questions to ensure there are no categories missed in VA.gov profile. While also planning to evaluate post launch search terms to see if users are finding the information they’re looking for in their profile.* 

**`4.` Post launch hypothesis: We believe we will see a decrease in top search terms as users will be able to find what they’re looking for within the profile.**

2. **Dependents/** If you were recently married and needed to update your spouse's information with the VA for benefits, where would you expect to do that?
3. **Heath care contacts/** Where would you expect to find your VA health care next of kin information?

### Analysis<a id=”analysis”></a>

#### Task success metrics
To determine success we’ll be evaluating the following metrics:
1. Success rate: The percentage of participants who completed a task. Goal is 80%+ success rate to confirm success, which is considered Very Good per Neilson Norman Group and Optimal Workshop. If the success rate is low we will evaluate Path.
2. Path: Routes the participants took to understand their navigation choices. If participants looked for a feature in another section, the team will re evaluate feature location.

[Optimal workshop analysis direction](https://support.optimalworkshop.com/en/collections/1524581-tree-testing?_gl=1*sd3k48*_gcl_au*ODU4MDMzMDEwLjE3NDU1ODY5MzY.)

[Neilson Normal Group recommendations on analysis](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interpreting-tree-test-results/) 

#### Open-ended questions
Open-ended questions will be analyzed by the moderator. Answers will be evaluated for themes and presented as options to the team for future feature sets.
