	# Research plan for Authenticated Experience Team, Profile, 03/2026

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Profile 2.0 introduces a reorganized, research-backed information architecture that aligns with Veteran mental models and creates space for new features. It restructures sections, updates naming, and groups related information more intuitively so the Profile can incorporate future additions without creating confusion.**
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**Authenticated profile experience**
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**Iterating on an existing product.**

**Key Takeaways from Previous Research:**
- `Veterans expect VA.gov Profile to be a “one-stop shop” and to reflect changes across VA.`
- `The proposed Profile hub navigation largely works, and Veterans reported high satisfaction.`
- `Veterans have discoverability and navigation challenges because they don’t know what Profile contains.`
- `Veterans want Profile to expand into “missing” categories—especially Dependents and Letters/Records—aligned to their mental models.`

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Validate profile experience and architecture changes with participants.**

`2.` **Identify any bugs, with special focus on data quality and accessibility.**

`3.` **Identify new product feature ideas.** 
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

`1.` **Ensure profile meets participant expectations and is a solid foundation for future work.**

`2.` **Bugs are identified, documented, and prioritized.**

`3.` **New feature ideas are documented and prioritized.** 

---

### Research questions

***Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:***
	
`What will I do with what I learn from this question?`
  
`Does this question serve the goals of my study?`

**`1.`Do participants have any challenges navigating to profile?**

**`2.`Do participants have difficulty navigating new profile categories?**

**`3.`Is there any information missing that participants want to see?**

**`4.`Are there any features missing that participants want to see? Such as wanting to edit or remove content?**

**`5.`Does the new experience meet participant expectations? Why or why not?**

**`6.`Are there any specific challenges screen reader or magnification participants face while using our new experience?**


### Hypotheses
 
**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

---

**`1.`Participants will not have difficulty navigating to the profile.**

**`2.`Participants will not have difficulty navigating the new categories in profile.**

**`3.`The new categories and content will meet participants expectations.**

**`4.`Participants will want to be able to edit and remove all information they see.**

**`5.`Participants will not want to call the help desk when their information is incorrect.**

**`6.`Using VADS and USDS accessibility guidance will ensure an experience that is easy to use for screen reader and magnification participants.**

**After kick-off**

- Requesting Perigean to confirm and prepare participants prior to the session.
- To confirm with each participant:
  - The assistive technology matches what the participant marked on the survey.
  - Device they’ll be using for the session. Mobile (iOS or Android) or Desktop.
  - The participants level of experience with assistive technology. Do they describe themselves as beginner, intermediate, or expert?
  - If participants have any additional accommodations they need for the session.
- Walk participants through setting up, and using, Zoom share prior to the session starting. [Link to platform guidance.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants#Recruiting-Recruitingformobilestudies)


### Prepare

## Timeline 🗓️
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **[Enter dates and times MM/DD HH:MM]**

**During kick-off**

- Review screener questions.
- Review recruitment email.
- Align on recruitment approach and timing.
- Review after kick-off tasks.

**After kick-off**

- Requesting Perigean to confirm and prepare participants prior to the session.
- To confirm with each participant:
  - Device they’ll be using for the session. Mobile (iOS or Android) or Desktop.
  - If participants have any additional accommodations they need for the session.
- Walk participants through setting up, and using, Zoom share prior to the session starting. [Link to platform guidance.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants#Recruiting-Recruitingformobilestudies)


### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

Study will be conducted on VA.gov production. Experience went live 03/13/2026.

**Pilot completed with AT participant recruitment.**

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions

- `Session length:` **60 minutes**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions:` **30 minutes**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day:` **2 per day**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.

> **Place time slots between `hash marks` when in edit mode.**
