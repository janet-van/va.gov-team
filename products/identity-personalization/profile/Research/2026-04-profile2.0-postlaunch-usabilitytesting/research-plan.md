## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>

`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Profile 2.0 introduces a reorganized, research-backed information architecture that aligns with Veteran mental models and creates space for new features.

`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**Authenticated profile experience**
  
`What is Veterans' familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**Iterating on an existing product.**

**Key Takeaways from Previous Research:**
- Veterans expect VA.gov Profile to be a "one-stop shop" and to reflect changes across VA
- The proposed Profile hub navigation largely works, and Veterans reported high satisfaction
- Veterans have discoverability and navigation challenges because they don't know what Profile contains
- Veterans want Profile to expand into "missing" categories—especially Dependents and Letters/Records—aligned to their mental models

## Research Goals 🥅

`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

> [!NOTE]
> Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

### Goals

1. **Validate profile experience and architecture changes with participants**

2. **Identify any bugs, with special focus on data quality and accessibility**

3. **Identify new product feature ideas**

### Outcome

1. Ensure profile meets participant expectations and is a solid foundation for subsequent work
2. Bugs are identified, documented, and prioritized
3. New feature ideas are documented and prioritized

### Research questions

***Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:***
	
`What will I do with what I learn from this question?`
  
`Does this question serve the goals of my study?`

1. **Do participants have any challenges navigating to profile?**

2. **Do participants have difficulty navigating new profile categories?**

3. **Is there any information missing that participants want to see?**

4. **Are there any features missing that participants want to see, such as wanting to edit or remove content?**

5. **Does the new experience meet participant expectations? Why or why not?**

6. **Are there any specific challenges screen reader or magnification participants face while using the new experience?**

### Hypotheses

**1. Participants will not have difficulty navigating to the profile**

**2. Participants will not have difficulty navigating the new categories in profile**

**3. The new categories and content will meet participants' expectations**

**4. Participants will want to be able to edit and remove all information they see**

**5. Participants will expect any information in their profile to be used across the VA**

**6. Using VADS and USDS accessibility guidance will ensure an experience that is easy to use for screen reader and magnification participants**

## Methodology 🛠️

**Moderated usability testing to evaluate the new profile experience.**
