## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

Form 21-2680 requires claimants (Veterans or their qualifying dependents) or their caregivers to have a medical provider fill out and sign a section verifying eligibility for Aid and Attendance or Housebound benefits. The claimant portion is already digitized on VA.gov; this research focuses on the experience veterans, dependents and caregivers have completing their part of the form and navigating the handoff to their provider.
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

Benefits & Claims section; authenticated experience.
  
`What is Veterans' familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

This is an iteration. The claimant (patient-facing) portion of Form 21-2680 is already digitized on VA.gov. This research explores the veteran, dependent, and caregiver experience in completing their section and coordinating with their provider for the provider section.

**`1.` How clear are the instructions and form fields?**

**`2.` What is the timeline and effort required to complete the claimant side?**

**`3.` How do veterans, dependents, and caregivers feel about their experience completing Form 21-2680?**

**Goal 3: Usability of digital form**

---

### Hypotheses

**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` We intend to uncover real workflows, pain points, and opportunities for supporting veterans and caregivers through the claimant-side experience.

`What do you already know about this problem space?` From stakeholder conversations, we know that:
- The handoff to providers is a frequent pain point.
- Veterans, dependents, and caregivers value clear instructions and simplicity.
- Some veterans may not fully understand what their provider needs to do.

`What do you think users will do or think about this product?` We anticipate:
- Veterans, dependents, and caregivers want a straightforward digital process.
- They may struggle with coordinating the handoff to their provider.
- Clear, contextual guidance could improve success rates.

---

**Key Hypotheses:**

- Veterans, dependents, and caregivers often experience confusion or delay in the provider handoff process.
- Asynchronous workflows (completing the form outside an appointment) may be more common, contrary to assumptions about synchronous provider involvement.
- Additional or clearer support resources would increase success and satisfaction for veterans, dependents, and caregivers completing the process.

## Methodology  🛠️

***Describe the method you're planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.*** 

**Research approach:**

1. **Semi-structured interviews** (with veterans, dependents, and caregivers) - Appropriate for generative research to understand real workflows, pain points, and decision-making processes around the claimant-side experience and provider handoff.
2. **Desktop research** - Review existing literature, forum posts, VA.gov analytics (if available), and any documented feedback on the claimant experience to supplement interview findings and identify patterns.

**Why these methods:** We are in the generative phase of understanding the veteran, dependent, and caregiver experience with Form 21-2680. Semi-structured interviews allow us to deeply explore real workflows, frustrations, and needs. Desktop research provides context and validates interview insights without additional participant burden.

- [X] **Remote**
- [ ] **In-person**

> [!NOTE]
> We are planning remote research via video calls or phone interviews. This allows us to reach geographically dispersed veterans, dependents, and caregivers, and accommodates varying schedules and accessibility needs.

## Research materials 📔

> [!NOTE]
> **Your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.**

## Recruitment 🎯	

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants.
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive in your recruitment.

### Recruitment approach

**We will recruit participants using Perigean:**
- Perigean will recruit 10 - 16 veterans, caregivers, and dependents to understand their experience with healthcare and benefits processes, and to gather feedback on the Form 21-2680 digital experience.

This approach allows us to reach a diverse group of veterans,dependents, and caregivers across the country.

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria (must-haves; these are the key criteria we need to meet for participation):**
- Veteran or caregiver or dependent of a Veteran (child, spouse, parent)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves; these criteria will be overlapping, but it does not matter how they overlap. we might not meet some of these criteria in this phase of the study which is ok.):**
- Receives a pension (6 - 9 participants)
- Has a service-related disability (6 - 9 participants)
- Currently receives SMP, SMC, or other benefit for aid and attendance / housebound allowance (3 - 6)
- Thinks they are eligible for aid and attendance / housebound allowance (2 - 3)
- Has a VHA medical provider (4 - 5)
- Has a private medical provider (4 - 5)

It would additionally strengthen our sample to include:
- LGBTQ+ Veterans and caregivers
- Veterans of color
- Women Veterans
- Veterans with cognitive disabilities
- Veterans without college degrees
- Veterans in rural areas

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:

> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **1.5x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 8 ideal completed sessions, request 10-12 total participants)*

- `Veterans:` **6 - 9**
- `Caregivers:` **4 - 6**
- `Dependents:` **4 - 6**
- `Total:` **12 - 18**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **12**

## Screener Questions 📋

> [!NOTE]
> Perigean will use these screener questions **verbatim** to recruit and qualify participants. Write them as you want them asked.

> [!TIP]
> - Write questions in plain language that participants will easily understand.
> - Clearly indicate the **qualifying response** that will make someone eligible.
> - Include links to products or clear descriptions so participants understand what they're being asked about.
> - The more screener questions you have, the harder it will be to recruit - prioritize your must-haves.
