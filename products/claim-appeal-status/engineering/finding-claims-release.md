# Finding Claims Release

**Feature flag**: `cst_claims_list_filter`

## Google Analytics Release Monitoring

[CST Claims Filter Release](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/analysis/a50123418p419143770/edit/6zMUJcZSTQCnSvzojYA7Kg)

Create or update the following GA4 Explore tabs to monitor the rollout. Record baseline and post-release values in the tables below to share with stakeholders.

- Release date: April 7, 2026
  - Fully Enabled Feature Flag at 10:45 PM ET. This allowed all users to get the new feature (and view it being used in all Datadog replays) while not being at the peak hours of the day
  - I watched a few dozen Datadog replays as well as looked at the frustration count. Neither showed anything concerning.
- Baseline: Mar 31 - Apr 6 (7 days before release)
- Post-release: Apr 7 - Apr 13 (first 7 days after release)
- Week 2: Apr 14 - Apr 20 (for trend comparison)

Use matching day-of-week windows to account for weekday/weekend traffic differences. Tables below use "Baseline" and "Post-release" as shorthand for these periods.

### Filter Clicks

- Goal: Monitor each filter button's usage (In progress, Closed, All). Confirm the component and analytics events are working. Assess how users interact with the filter.
- Rows: Link text
- Values: Event count
- Cell Type: Bar chart
- Filters:
  - DataLayer Event Name exactly matches `int-button-segmented-click`
  - Page path and screen class matches regex `.*track-claims/your-claims/?`
- Note: The GA4 event name is `button`, but that captures all button clicks on the page. Using `DataLayer Event Name = int-button-segmented-click` isolates just the segmented filter clicks. The Link text column will show "In progress", "Closed", and "All".

### On This Page Clicks

- Goal: Monitor all On This Page clicks. Confirm the new heading "If you can't find your claim, decision review, or appeal" appears and is being clicked.
- Rows: Link text
- Values: Event count
- Cell Type: Bar chart
- Filters:
  - Page path and screen class matches regex `.*track-claims/your-claims/?`
  - Event name exactly matches `on_this_page`

### Your Claims Events

- Goal: Monitor all events on the claims landing page only (not detail pages) to catch unexpected changes in user interactions.
- Rows: Event name, DataLayer Event Name, Link text
- Values: Event count
- Cell Type: Bar chart
- Filters:
  - Page path and screen class matches regex `.*track-claims/your-claims/?`

### Claim Detail Page Navigation

- Goal: Confirm users are still navigating to claim detail pages at normal rates. A drop could mean the default In progress filter is hiding claims users expect to see.
- Rows: Page path and screen class
- Values: Sessions
- Cell Type: Bar chart
- Filters:
  - Page referrer contains `/track-claims/your-claims`
  - Page path and screen class matches regex `.*track-claims/your-claims/[0-9].*`

### Appeal Detail Page Navigation

- Goal: Confirm users are still navigating to appeal detail pages at normal rates. A drop could mean closed appeals (now behind the Closed filter) are harder to find.
- Rows: Page path and screen class
- Values: Sessions
- Cell Type: Bar chart
- Filters:
  - Page referrer contains `/track-claims/your-claims`
  - Page path and screen class contains `/track-claims/appeals/`

### Outbound Navigation

- Goal: Ensure there is no unexpected change in where users navigate from the claims landing page.
- Rows: Page path and screen class
- Values: Sessions
- Cell Type: Bar chart
- Filters:
  - Page referrer matches regex `.*track-claims/your-claims/?`

### Report: April 1 vs April 8

Single-day comparison: Wednesday April 1 (pre-release) vs Wednesday April 8 (first full day post-release). Same day of week for a fair comparison.

**Traffic baseline**: Sessions on the claims landing page were essentially identical between the two days (Apr 1: 69,696 vs Apr 8: 69,782, +0.12%). This means all behavioral changes below are real shifts in user behavior from the feature, not traffic differences.

#### Filter Clicks

| Filter Label | Apr 1 | Apr 8 |
|---|---|---|
| Closed | N/A | 18,277 |
| All | N/A | 13,445 |
| In progress | N/A | 12,454 |

Users are actively engaging with the filter (44,176 total clicks). Closed has the most clicks (41%), which is expected since In progress is the default -- users who want to see closed claims must actively click.

#### On This Page Clicks

| Link Text | Apr 1 | Apr 8 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Totals | 33,594 | 31,568 | -6% |
| Your claim letters | 15,253 | 12,845 | -16% |
| Your claims, decision reviews, or appeals | 14,468 | 14,925 | +3% |
| What if I can't find my claim, decision review, or appeal? | 1,498 | 1 | replaced |
| If you can't find your claim, decision review, or appeal | 0 | 1,648 | new |
| Additional services | 1,405 | 1,354 | -4% |
| Your travel reimbursement claims | 883 | 706 | -20% |
| Contact us | 81 | 79 | -2% |

The heading swap from "What if I can't find..." to "If you can't find..." completed cleanly (old dropped to 1, new at 1,648). The new heading is getting +10% more clicks than the old one (1,648 vs 1,498). Contact us is flat, indicating no user confusion.

#### Your Claims Events

| Event | Apr 1 | Apr 8 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| page_view | 127,799 | 173,485 | +36% |
| link_click / Details | 56,489 | 48,914 | -13% |
| additional_info / int-additional-info-collapse / "Find out why we sometimes combine claims" | 51 | 0 | -100% (removed) |
| button / int-button-segmented-click | N/A | 44,176 | new |

The +36% page_view increase (45,686 additional views) is explained by the 44,176 filter clicks. Each filter click calls `navigate()` to reset pagination, which triggers a new page_view event. Sessions confirm traffic was flat (+0.12%).

The -13% drop in Details link clicks is a real behavioral change on flat traffic. With the default In progress filter showing only active claims, users see a smaller, more relevant list and click into fewer claims to find what they need.

The "Find out why we sometimes combine claims" additional info component dropped to 0 events, confirming it was successfully removed.

#### Claim Detail Page Navigation

| Metric | Apr 1 | Apr 8 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total sessions | 53,580 | 50,605 | -5.5% |

On flat traffic, 5.5% fewer sessions navigated to claim detail pages. This aligns with the -13% Details click drop -- the In progress filter surfaces the most relevant claims first, reducing the need to click through multiple claims.

#### Appeal Detail Page Navigation

| Metric | Apr 1 | Apr 8 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total sessions | 15,348 | 14,177 | -7.6% |

On flat traffic, 7.6% fewer sessions navigated to appeal detail pages. Closed appeals are now behind the Closed filter. Worth monitoring over the full week -- if this trend continues, it could indicate users are having trouble finding closed appeals.

#### Outbound Navigation

| Top Destination | Apr 1 | Apr 8 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| /track-claims/your-claim-letters | 14,579 | 20,624 | +41% |
| / | 13,912 | 14,048 | +1% |
| /track-claims/your-claims (combined with trailing slash) | 15,862 | 21,457 | +35% |
| /my-va/ | 5,100 | 5,077 | -0.5% |
| /contact-us/ | 128 | 123 | -4% |

The +41% increase in claim letters navigation is a real behavioral change on flat traffic. The cause is unclear from GA data alone.

The +35% increase in self-navigation is expected -- filter clicks trigger `navigate()` to reset pagination.

Homepage, My VA, and Contact us are all flat, confirming no disruption to normal navigation patterns.

#### Overall Analysis

On identical traffic (69,696 vs 69,782 sessions), the filter release shows:

- **No regressions**: No increase in contact us navigation, no unexpected drops
- **Strong filter adoption**: 44,176 filter clicks on day one, with Closed (41%) as the most-clicked filter
- **Users finding claims faster**: The -13% Details click drop and -5.5% claim detail session drop suggest the In progress default surfaces relevant claims more efficiently, reducing the number of claims users need to click into
- **Content changes landed cleanly**: The "If you can't find" heading replaced the old heading completely (1,498 to 1), and the new heading is getting 10% more engagement
- **One metric to watch**: Appeal detail sessions dropped 7.6%. This could indicate closed appeals are slightly harder to find behind the Closed filter. Continue monitoring over the full week before taking action
- **Claim letters navigation increased**: +41% increase in navigation to claim letters. Cause unclear from GA data alone.

## Datadog RUM Release Monitoring

Datadog RUM (service: `benefits-claim-status-tool`) detects user frustration signals (rage clicks, dead clicks, error clicks) that GA cannot. A monitor is configured to alert the team if frustration spikes after release.



### Before/After Frustration Comparison

Use the RUM Explorer to compare frustration levels before and after release:

1. Open the [RUM Explorer with frustration filter](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/rum/sessions?query=@type:view%20service:benefits-claim-status-tool%20@view.url_path:/track-claims/your-claims%20@view.frustration.count:%3E0&agg_m=count&agg_m_source=base&agg_t=count&fromUser=true&viz=stream&from_ts=1775496671753&to_ts=1775669471753&live=true)
2. Switch to Timeseries view and set the time range to cover both the baseline and post-release periods
3. Eyeball the chart for a visible increase in frustration count after the release timestamp (April 7, 10:45 PM ET)
4. If the post-release frustration level looks noticeably higher than the baseline, investigate using the steps below

| Metric | Baseline | Post-Release | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Views with frustration (`@view.frustration.count:>0`) | | | | |

### Frustration Monitor

- Monitor: [CST - High Frustration on /track-claims/your-claims](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/monitors/549183?from_ts=1775500840739&to_ts=1775587240739&live=true)
- Query: `rum("@type:view service:benefits-claim-status-tool @view.url_path:/track-claims/your-claims")`
- Evaluation: AVG frustration count over the last 5 minutes
- Thresholds:
  - Warning: 3 < avg <= 5
  - Alert: avg > 5
- Notifications: Slack `#benefits-management-tools-claim-status-tool-alerts`, William Phelps, Nathan Thomas
- Status at release: OK

### Investigating Frustration Signals

If the monitor triggers a warning or alert, or the before/after comparison shows an increase:

1. In the same RUM Explorer view, narrow the time range to the post-release spike
2. Filter for "Session Replay available" to watch affected sessions
3. Look for patterns: are users rage-clicking the filter buttons, claim cards, or pagination?
4. If frustration is concentrated on a specific interaction, investigate whether the component is unresponsive or confusing

## Staging Review Bug Bash

Log in and navigate to the claims landing page with the flag enabled. Verify all new behavior.

### Filter component

- [x] A segmented button with All, Active, and Closed appears below the "Your claims, decision reviews, or appeals" heading
  - _Did we ever check about making the segmented button full width on desktop?_
- [x] aria-label is "Claims status filter"
  - _Tracey will be testing this with screen reader but its in the html_
- [x] "All" is selected by default
